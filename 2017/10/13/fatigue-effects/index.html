			<p>A talk at the recent New England Symposium on Statistics in Sport (NESSIS) made me wonder whether we can observe player fatigue in tennis matches? and how?</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, I was fortunate to attend the 10th <a href="http://nessis.org/nessis17.html">NESSIS conference</a> and enjoy a full program of sports statisticians presenting on a variety of research topics. One of the talks that especially caught my attention was given by Kyle Burris, a PhD student in statistics at Duke University, who presented a method he had developed for measuring fatigue of relief pitchers in Major League Baseball. (If you want to see the full talk between Division Series games, you can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umdYkPLLEqo">here</a></p>
<div class="getty embed image" style="background-color:#fff;display:inline-block;font-family:Roboto,sans-serif;color:#a7a7a7;font-size:11px;width:100%;max-width:229px;padding:2%;float:left;"><div style="padding:0;margin:0;text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.gettyimages.com.au/detail/470044918" target="_blank" style="color:#a7a7a7;text-decoration:none;font-weight:normal !important;border:none;display:inline-block;">Embed from Getty Images</a></div><div style="overflow:hidden;position:relative;height:0;padding:180.54712% 0 0 0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/470044918?et=316d9aJITNN671d_nJSFGg&tld=com.au&sig=C0Tuwmt-tIDnAE1Vp2fGNjUSuZiq-nG_1Bzog2VW1CQ=&caption=true&ver=1" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" width="329" height="594" style="display:inline-block;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;"></iframe></div></div>
<p>The basic idea behind Kyle&rsquo;s approach was to think of fatigue as a cumulative phenomenon, which, with repeated tiring actions, results in a gradual decline in performance. The analogy he made— which seemed quite a compelling one to me— was to think of fatigue like an energy-sapping drug where the dose is some kind of competitive activity. No athlete wants to take such a drug, of course, but the idea is a useful one for thinking about how the fatigue/performance relationship could evolve and be modeled.</p>
<p>As with relief pitchers and pitching speeds, one would expect that greater fatigue in tennis would cause a decline in service speeds. The chart below gives a conceptual representation of how fatigue could manifest in service speeds. Here, the fatigue &ldquo;dose&rdquo; is measured by the number of serves a player has performed so far in a match.</p>
<div style="padding:2%;">
<img src="/img/fatigue_model.png" width=400 />
</div>
<p><strong>But do effects like these exist at the elite level?</strong></p>
<p>Few top players have had as many public struggles with fitness and injury so early in their career as Milos Raonic. This makes him a natural test case for a fatigue model.</p>
<p>After look over Raonic&rsquo;s service data for his matches at the 2017 Australian Open, the fourth round match at Roberto Bautista Agut turned out to have an especially interesting pattern. Below are Raonic&rsquo;s service times against his service count in that match (in KPH).</p>
<div style="padding:2%;">
<img src="/img/raonic_speed_R4.png" width=600 />
</div>
<p>There are a few things we can observe from this chart. First, Raonic&rsquo;s speeds on the first serve appeared relatively stable, with a few slow-paced outliers in the middle of the match, which could indicate a kind of &ldquo;change up&rdquo; serve. The second serves, on the other hand, show a suggestive decline.</p>
<p>Focusing just on the second serves, we can look for evidence of fatigue by searching for a good fit among some standard dose-response models. These models are traditionally used to model a therapeutic response relative to a drug dose, and are highly non-linear in their form, the log-logistic being one of the most popular examples. In this case, we are applying the model to describe changes in speed with the serve count (our &ldquo;dose&rdquo;).</p>
<p>There is a really nice R package <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146021">drc</a> that makes does-response modeling quite accessible. I looked at several available models for a continuous response and found that a four-parameters log-logistic provided the best overall fit. The fatigue curve estimated by this model is shown below and clearly suggests a decline with increasing serve count.</p>
<div style="padding:2%;">
<img src="/img/raonic_speed_fatigue.png" width=600 />
</div>
<p>Decline in speed isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing if it is small (especially for a big server like Raonic). How can we judge a decline (i.e. fatigue effect) that might be of concern for a player&rsquo;s performance?</p>
<p>There is no one correct answer here but one guideline I think is useful is to use the gap between a typical first and second serve as a reference point, as we know the effectiveness between these two service types are inarguably relevant. Most male serves drop about 15% in speed from the first to second.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the &ldquo;effective fatigue&rdquo; for a 5, 10, and 15% decline in initial service speeds (the first to second serve gap) implied by Raonic&rsquo;s fatigue in the fourth round. The dose-response curve suggests that Roanic reached a decline of high concern by the 104th serve in the match.</p>
<div style="padding:2%;">
<img src="/img/raonic_speed_ed.png" width=400 />
</div>
<p>This small case study suggests that there is some promising work to be done with fatigue modeling in tennis and looking at service speeds is a natural place to start.</p>
<p>One obvious question that this illustration does raise, however, is why, if what is happening in Raonic&rsquo;s second serve is truly a fatigue effect, do we not observe the same on the first serve? I think a possible explanation of this has to do with the different serves a player might use on the first and second. A player will tend to go for a fast and flatter type of serve on the first, but use a spinner kick serve on the second. Because the mechanics involved with these two service types are quite different, they could exert a different energy cost and explain the different patterns observed by service number.</p>
<p>But this is just one possible guess and there is plenty left to delve into to better understand fatigue effects in tennis.</p>
