      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a walkover from Kohlschreiber in the R64, Stefanos Tsitsipas advanced to the third round with one fewer match played this week than any of his competitors. As Tsitsipas takes the court today for a spot in the 4th round, we look at whether skipping a round of play could have an impact on his result at the first slam of the season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his win over Roger Federer, 20 year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas not only earned the biggest upset of the 2019 Australian Open so far, he caused many to wonder whether tennis was seeing the start of a new era. Tsitsipas&amp;rsquo;s journey at the 2019 AO is the biggest of multiple success stories for a young crop of talents on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour, stories that have already made this year one of the most unique in AO history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a super tiebreak in the deciding set of singles matches was one of a number of changes at the 2019 Australian Open. After two rounds, 3 men&amp;rsquo;s and 2 women&amp;rsquo;s matches have already put that rule to the test. What do the outcomes of those matches tell us about the possible impact of the new format?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
