      <description>&lt;p&gt;The draws are out for the 2022 edition of Roland Garros. With Rafael Nadal&amp;rsquo;s drought in clay Masters titles this season, it has been one of the more surprising lead ups to the clay slam in over a decade. With the skyrocketing success of Carlos Alcaraz, signs that Novak Djokovic is returning to form, and Nadal&amp;rsquo;s fitness up in the air; the stage is set for a thrilling fight for the French Open men&amp;rsquo;s title. Which matches are more likely to deliver the most thrills in the first rounds?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The French Open during Rafa&amp;rsquo;s reign has been a foregone conclusion in most years. But this year, it&amp;rsquo;s Swiatek who is the heaviest favorite at the event. The main question is which among her challengers can make this a more competitive event than expected? And before we know who might be fighting for the title, which womens matches are likely to be the must-sees of the first rounds?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
