      <description>&lt;p&gt;The performances of Daniil Medvedev and Matteo Berrettini at the 2019 US Open showed that the future of men&amp;rsquo;s tennis is bright. In this post, I look at the point-by-point pressure each of these young stars had to confront and analyze how well they responded to it in each round of their US Open journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the close of the second month of the 2019 season, we look back at the biggest pressure performances of the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. Reilley Opelka takes top honours for having faced the most service pressure in a match in February, racking up 15.5 break point equivalents (BPEs) against John Isner in New York. Opelka also saved the most of the BPEs faces winning a whopping 92% of high-pressure service points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Best Quantify Service Pressure</title>
      <link>https://skoval.github.io/2019/01/29/break-point-units/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pressure is one of those concepts in tennis that we all know exists but we struggle to calculate. I&amp;rsquo;ve made multiple attempts at quantifying scoreboard pressure and have yet to come around to one that is both statistically useful and easy to interpret. But some recent experimenting has uncovered what I think could be as close to a &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; statistic for pressure as I am likely to find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After introducing &lt;em&gt;Pressure Ratings&lt;/em&gt; for matches, this post looks at how a similar approach can be used to develop a &lt;em&gt;Set Competitiveness&lt;/em&gt; rating for players. The &lt;em&gt;Set Competitiveness&lt;/em&gt; measures the pressure of a player&amp;rsquo;s sets in a way that allows direct ranking against the pressure typically faced by other players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;rsquo;s 252-point Paris Masters semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer got many wondering whether it was the best match in their 47 match long rivalry. In this post, I introduce a pressure rating for sets and matches that can help to tell us to rate their relative competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
