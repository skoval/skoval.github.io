      <title>Return Impact Head-to-Heads</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Head-to-heads are one of the most fascinating aspects of tennis. While it&amp;rsquo;s easy to look up who is ahead on one record or another, there are still many fundamental patterns of play that we can&amp;rsquo;t easily compare across players. This post goes a small (but I hope interesting) way towards remedying that by introducing a head-to-head visualization tool for comparing the return impact patterns of ATP players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once we can measure player impact patterns on the return, it is natural to use these patterns to compare players. This post delves into these comparisons and presents a set of distinct impact types that describe the impact styles of top ATP players when returning the first serve on hardcourts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Return Impact Maps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which of the top ATP players are the most aggressive on the serve return? Which are the most defensive? Is Andrey Rublev&amp;rsquo;s serve return style closer to Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s or Novak Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s? In this post, I introduce an interactive visualization tool to help answer these and many other questions about the return impact of top men&amp;rsquo;s tennis players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Foray Into Return Impact Patterns</title>
      <link>https://skoval.github.io/2020/11/28/return-impact/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The serve return is the most important shot for a receiver.  What can receivers do to put themselves in a better position to make a good impact on the serve return? The answer to that question is too big a task for one blog post alone. As a small first step, I take a look at a new public data source that includes the position of players at the time of return impact in ATP matches. Through a handful of case studies, it delves into the kind of patterns in return positioning these data could help reveal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
