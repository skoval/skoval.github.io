      <title>Putting a Basic Playing Style Classifier to the Test</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any measure of playing style is only as good as what it can explain beyond player overall ability. If we apply this standard to playing style categories derived from basic match stats, how do they hold up?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I looked at whether basic match stats, like aces and minutes played per point, could help describe a player&amp;rsquo;s playing style. In this post, I expand on the set of style features and delve into the clusters of playing styles they reveal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few posts on head-to-head effects. The biggest takeaway was one we probably all knew going in: Head-to-head effects may exist, but good luck finding them. With so many small sample sizes for most head-to-heads, we need a way to group &amp;lsquo;similar&amp;rsquo; players. In this post, I look at whether categorizing players by playing style might be possible using basic match stats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you thought Serena vs Maria was a lopsided head-to-head, you are right. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest head-to-head effect in recent WTA history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matchup effects are a common idea in tennis commentary. It is the thing at the heart of comments like &amp;lsquo;her game matches up well&amp;rsquo; against her opponent. One way to think of a matchup effect is as a surprising head-to-head, when results go against what the overall ability of both players would have us expect. Do such effects exist? And are they substantial enough that they matter when it comes to making better predictions about tennis results?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Novak Djokovic looked unstoppable at the Australian Open and he heads into Indian Wells as the hands down favourite for the title. With GIG predictions giving him a 1 and 2 chance to win the whole thing, the question of the event will be whether anyone can stop Djokovic?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the close of the second month of the 2019 season, we look back at the biggest pressure performances of the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. Reilley Opelka takes top honours for having faced the most service pressure in a match in February, racking up 15.5 break point equivalents (BPEs) against John Isner in New York. Opelka also saved the most of the BPEs faces winning a whopping 92% of high-pressure service points.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assessing the Fit of a Serve Prediction Model</title>
      <link>https://skoval.github.io/2019/02/22/serve-model-check/</link>

      <guid>https://skoval.github.io/2019/02/22/serve-model-check/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A model that could predict a player&amp;rsquo;s performance on serve would have a number of interesting uses like forecasting the outcome of matches or identifying surprising performances. But for any of these uses the model would need to be accurate and reliable. How should we evaluate a model&amp;rsquo;s performance? And how do we know when a model is good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every player has days when everything seems to work and other days when nothing seems to go right. Saying when a player has truly over (or under) performed is tricky in tennis because there is always an opponent on the other side of the net that is also influencing the outcome of points. In this post, I look at a basic strategy to try to isolate the ability of the server and receiver, and discuss how this might be used to identify surprising performances on serve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Best Quantify Service Pressure</title>
      <link>https://skoval.github.io/2019/01/29/break-point-units/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pressure is one of those concepts in tennis that we all know exists but we struggle to calculate. I&amp;rsquo;ve made multiple attempts at quantifying scoreboard pressure and have yet to come around to one that is both statistically useful and easy to interpret. But some recent experimenting has uncovered what I think could be as close to a &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; statistic for pressure as I am likely to find.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his win over Roger Federer, 20 year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas not only earned the biggest upset of the 2019 Australian Open so far, he caused many to wonder whether tennis was seeing the start of a new era. Tsitsipas&amp;rsquo;s journey at the 2019 AO is the biggest of multiple success stories for a young crop of talents on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour, stories that have already made this year one of the most unique in AO history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a super tiebreak in the deciding set of singles matches was one of a number of changes at the 2019 Australian Open. After two rounds, 3 men&amp;rsquo;s and 2 women&amp;rsquo;s matches have already put that rule to the test. What do the outcomes of those matches tell us about the possible impact of the new format?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the first round of the Australian Open, I take a look at some of the likely winners on the men&amp;rsquo;s side. The forecast bodes well for the Big 3, with Novak Djokovic leading the race toward the first slam title of the 2019 season.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After introducing &lt;em&gt;Pressure Ratings&lt;/em&gt; for matches, this post looks at how a similar approach can be used to develop a &lt;em&gt;Set Competitiveness&lt;/em&gt; rating for players. The &lt;em&gt;Set Competitiveness&lt;/em&gt; measures the pressure of a player&amp;rsquo;s sets in a way that allows direct ranking against the pressure typically faced by other players.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;rsquo;s 252-point Paris Masters semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer got many wondering whether it was the best match in their 47 match long rivalry. In this post, I introduce a pressure rating for sets and matches that can help to tell us to rate their relative competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Novak Djokovic will regain the World No. 1 ranking, climbing from outside the top 20 at the start of the year. Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s comeback has been the major story this week. In this post, I look at his rise in terms of his match-by-match Elo rating and put it in context of his best season performances in 2011 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Novak Djokovic could continue a masterful run toward the end of the season when he goes for his second 2018 Masters 1000 title against Borna Coric in Shanghai. Even before the final, Djokovic sits at the top of men&amp;rsquo;s current all-surface Elo ratings. In this post we look at the how the current top 8 on the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s tours have won there place among the ratings leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prize money has been the primary yardstick for measuring gender inequality in professional tennis. Most in-depth studies of prize money differences have focused on earnings of top players or prize money commitments by tournament. In this post, I take a different view on prize money differences by focusing on earning opportunities in each week of the the tour calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are into the quarterfinals at the 2018 US Open. No matter what happens in the final days of the event, we already know that one of the major storylines of this year will be Alexander Zverev&amp;rsquo;s failure to get to the second week. Zverev&amp;rsquo;s third round loss to Philipp Kohlschreiber makes the 14th loss at a slam, 13 of which have been before the quarterfinals. With this slam record, what hopes does the twenty-one year-old have for getting that elusive first Major?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After two rounds in extreme heat conditions, the 2018 US Open has seen 12 men&amp;rsquo;s singles matches end in retirement. Is this a historic high for the number of early retirements at a slam? And how do high retirement counts impact the progress of the draw?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2018 Wimbledon, the women&amp;rsquo;s seeds struggled to an unprecedented degree. Was this bad luck? Or a sign of the competitiveness of the women&amp;rsquo;s tour?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Record numbers of seeds are falling in the early rounds at Wimbledon.
We look at exactly how unprecedented these results are, whether this is part of a larger trend, and which first-round shock was the most unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With his haul of 8 titles, Roger Federer has triumphed at Wimbledon more than anyone else. But how does 8 titles compare with how many we could have expected him to win given his level&amp;mdash;and his competition&amp;mdash;over the years? And which title was his most impressive? [Authored by Graeme Spence]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The intermittent rain and late nights at the 2018 French Open have resulted in multiple interrupted matches, including the bottom half of the men&amp;rsquo;s quarterfinals. We often have the impression that reversals and big swings are more likely with an interrupted match. Does the data back up this impression of the impact of suspended play?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In reaching the quarterfinal at the 2018 French Open, Alexander Zverev not only has earned the best Grand Slam result of his career, he also joins a short list of 4 men in the Open Era who have played 3 or more five-set matches on their way to the Roland Garros quarterfinals. Is Zverev&amp;rsquo;s gruelling journey to the second week most likely to hurt or help his chances for the title?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, as part of the final R16 lineup at the French Open, Serena Williams will have the opportunity to bring her near-perfect record over Maria Sharapova to a staggering 20 to 2. Many have wondered how much Williams&amp;rsquo; dominance over the &amp;lsquo;Unstoppable&amp;rsquo; author is fuelled by more than pure ability. In this post, we attempt to understand the &lt;i&gt;inexplicable&lt;/i&gt; part of their head-to-head.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The red dirt of Roland Garros, which has held the attention of the tennis world this week, is the most defining feature of the only clay-court Grand Slam. But, when it comes to performance, is clay losing its distinctiveness? In this guest post, Graeme Spence, delves into the closing gap in surface specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2019, Grand Slams will have just 16 seeds. Top players have expressed concerns that this change will make it harder for them to advance to the latter stages of Majors and make for less competitive matches as the events progress. Are they right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roger Federer drew the toughest quarter of the 2018 Men&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open draw but is still the favourite to defend his title. Who else is a contender for the men&amp;rsquo;s title?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andy Murray&amp;rsquo;s withdrawal from the Australian Open topped the list of a series of unfortunate absences to start the men&amp;rsquo;s 2018 tennis season. Are the physical demands of the current game causing burn out at the top of the sport?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;resurgence&amp;rdquo; of Roger Federer has been one of the biggest storylines of the 2017 season. After the end of Federer&amp;rsquo;s season at the ATP Tour Finals, how does it rank among his past seasons? and what is the best metric for judging season accomplishments?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Elo rating system is one of the most popular tools for rating player and team performance. In this post, I show how we can take the Elo system beyond match wins and use it to rate players on the two most fundamental skills in the sport: serving and returning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2017 MLB World Series gave baseball fans a thrill-ride for the post-season. It also gives us an idea of how to size up the excitement of a sporting event. In this post, we look at an &amp;lsquo;excitement&amp;rsquo; statistic for tennis and use it to rank the excitement of men&amp;rsquo;s matches at the 2017 US Open.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the major tennis storylines of 2017 has been the opening up of the field on the WTA tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a number of former dominant players, like Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka, out of the game and others, like Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova, still early in their return, 2017 has presented a massive opportunity to the tour&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;rising stars. Out of 13 Premier and Grand Slam events completed this season, 10 different women have taken the title win. This has given tennis fans many possible picks for who will emerge as the next major threat on the WTA tour.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It only took a few days of main draw play for the 2017 French Open to give fodder to debates on the unpredictability of this year&amp;rsquo;s women&amp;rsquo;s tour. After two rounds, just 9 of the 32 seeds survived to the round of 32, 23 fewer than expected. Those numbers caused &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/06/tennis-channel-roland-garros-2017-wta-player-draft-update-french-open/66477/&#34;&gt;tennis.com&lt;/a&gt; to conclude that the women&amp;rsquo;s draw was &amp;ldquo;decimated&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The French Open draw is out and Round 1 is only hours away. Four of the names that will be watched closely on the men&amp;rsquo;s side are 9-time champion Rafael Nadal, defending champion Novak Djokovic, defending finalist Andy Murray, and aspiring title-contender Dominic Thiem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I took a look at the clay-court serve performance of four of the ATP players most in contention for the 2017 Roland Garros title&amp;mdash; Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2017/05/21/Top-Contenders-French-Open/&#34;&gt;That analysis&lt;/a&gt; showed that Rafael Nadal has so far separated himself on serve by 5 to 15 percentage points on average. An impressive stat next to anyone but especially when compared to the players who are some of his toughest rivals for another Major win.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that the dust has settled at the Rome Masters, the tennis world is turning its focus to the French Open, where main draw play is nearly upon us. With Roger Federer skipping Roland Garros when not injured for the first time since he first played the event in 1999, the four names that will be most in the discussion for the win are Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. In this post, we look at the clay court season so far and what it tells us about the form for each of these top contenders going into the second Major of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

the 68th ranked player on tour, Anett Kontaveit, in straight sets. Despite holding the best rank on tour, Kerber has seemed in a slump for most of the season with early round loses becoming a norm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this point in the clay season, many of us were expecting Andy Murray to have appeared in at least one or more finals and maybe even snagged a title. But with a Round of 16 loss this week to Borna Coric at the Mutua Madrid Open, Murray has crashed out earlier than expected for his third clay court event of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every match win involves some luck. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the coin toss or the bounce off a clipped net, some events in a tennis match are outside of a player&amp;rsquo;s control. And the sport accepts that. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept it when it comes to line calls, especially when there is technology that can prevent line call errors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite starting the 2017 season as World No. 1 for the first time in his career, Andy Murray has had a lackluster go of it so far. After Murray&amp;rsquo;s Round of 16 loss at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, his match record was 13 and 4. Now, in terms of wins and losses alone, that puts him on par with his performances thru the end of April in 2016 and 2014, but far behind his record in 2015 when he had bagged 23 wins and just 5 losses by this point in the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The tennis world is abuzz with speculation over the future of Serena Williams. In an already extraordinary week in which the 23 Grand Slam title-owning champion was projected to reclaim the World No. 1 without having played an event since this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open, Williams, in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/04/19/serena-williams-reveals-20-weeks-pregnant/&#34;&gt;cheeky snapchat post&lt;/a&gt;, announced that she was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With less than 2 weeks until Maria Sharapova makes her return, there is a growing stir of speculation over her comeback. Having already been granted controversial wild cards and 3 Premier events, including the upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/03/caroline-wozniacki-venus-williams-maria-sharapova-wildcard-stuttgart/64746/&#34;&gt;Stuttgart Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, Sharapova&amp;mdash;after 15 months out of the game&amp;mdash;will return to tennis with a unique opportunity to avoid the usual entry prohibitions of unranked players. Her first match will be in the middle of the first round of Stuttgart on April 26th where she will have a chance to take 470 ranking points.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the first quarter of the 2017 season, Roger Federer has his 18th Grand Slam title and a 19-1 win record overall. Such an impressive start naturally leads us to ask: Where should we rank Federer&amp;rsquo;s 2017 start against the other seasons of his career? How does it compare to the best season starts in tennis history?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With modern tracking data, it is possible to get an almost continuous representation of the locations of both the ball and players during a tennis match. The richness of these data is a huge boon for tennis research but it comes with some challenges too. A lot of my time these days is spent thinking about how best to visualise this information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If tennis fans thought Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open win over Rafael Nadal was a fluke in an otherwise lopsided head-to-head, Federer&amp;rsquo;s devastating victory over Nadal this week at the Indian Wells Masters was a clear message that the AO won&amp;rsquo;t be a one-off for his 2017 season.&lt;/p&gt;

Co-founded by Daryl Morey, general manager for the Houston Rockets&amp;mdash;a team that, during his tenure, has shaped its identity around its relentless and often innovative use of stats&amp;mdash;SSAC has become one of the most popular events for academics and hobbyists to share cutting edge research in sports data science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With all of the tiers that exist on the professional tennis circuit, from 10K events up to the Majors, I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered how tournament tiers should be factored into Elo predictions and whether some events should be excluded entirely. The standard Elo gives players a bigger boost (10% exactly) for wins at Majors but treats wins against similar opponents at any other event the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With only two of the top 8 seeds reaching the quarterfinals at the first Grand Slam of the year, the 2017 Australian Open was a trainwreck for most prediction models. Even the Elo forecasting system, one of the most accurate open prediction approaches in tennis, couldn&amp;rsquo;t have anticipated the unusual conditions of this year&amp;rsquo;s Major down under.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, you are spending the day after the final match of the 2017 Australian Open looking for ways to relive the startling 35th meeting of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. At the start of the tournament, the chances that Federer would win the title were just 3%; Nadal was an even greater underdog with just 1.5%. Seeing either of them in the final match at Rod Laver Arena wasn&amp;rsquo;t suppose to happen. Yet here we are the day after both men defied the odds and produced what is likely to be one of the most storied moments in tennis history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Even with the men&amp;rsquo;s final still to come, we can already say that the 2017 Australian Open brought more surprises than anyone expected. As much as we will be focused on the surprise of another Williams sister final and the 35th meeting of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overlook the less familiar names that impressed us at the first Slam of the season.
Since it is sometimes hard to look back at two weeks of matchplay and pick out the performances that surprised us most, I was thinking how you might try to put a number to &amp;ldquo;improvement&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the prospect of a Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer final at this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open, many are probably wondering if we are in store for the relatively speedy match when they last played here in 2014 or an epic more like their four-hour plus semifinal at the 2012 AO. There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much that is predictable about this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open. One had to be clairvoyant to have picked a Nadal-Federer final (if that turns out to be what we get) let alone how long such a meeting could last.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I write, Andy Murray and Mischa Zverev are battling for a place in the quarterfinals in what has the makings of an epic. Another match we all hope will deliver the same excitement is Rafael Nadal and Gael Monfils&amp;rsquo; meeting on Monday, in the marquee night match on Rod Laver Arena.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The clouds that have rolled in over Melbourne Park on Day 5 of the 2017 Australian Open seem to be a reminder of the strange events the day before. The ousting of Novak Djokovic by Denis Istomin and Aga Radwanska by Mirjana Lucic-Baroni made Day 4 one of the most shocking of the event so far.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the curious things about tennis is that every seeded player&amp;rsquo;s path to the title is different. When the champions are hoisting a tournament trophy over their heads, we largely ignore the role that luck might have played in their victory. But should it be ignored? And how much of a role does luck play anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week of the 2017 tennis season saw the debut of many of the world&amp;rsquo;s best players. One of the players that tennis fans will be expecting the most from is the recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/british-tennis-star-andy-murray-knighted-after-amazing-season/news-story/6191b34118355421ef96820aa18c2bdc&#34;&gt;knighted Sir Andy Murray&lt;/a&gt;. Not just because of the knighthood but because of last year&amp;rsquo;s miraculous season that propelled that honour and saw Murray do the impossible: take the World No. 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In my last post, I took a look at the distances covered in matches and points for male players. The stats from Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group showed that men at the Australian Open travel 2 to 3 miles per match and the big servers of the game tend to travel the least of all players.
But what about the women&amp;rsquo;s tour? What are the typical distances for them and who are the biggest movers?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a tennis match broadcast you will sometimes see a stat on the distances run by players. But we rarely get a look at the distances run over all matches in a tournament or a season, numbers that could tell us what kinds of distances are typical at the elite level and what are extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s games differ the most is the serve. While previous posts on this site have shown that the speeds of men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s groundstrokes are actually &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2016/11/26/AOLeaderboard-Forehand-Speed/&#34;&gt;fairly comparable&lt;/a&gt;, the men separate themselves by far on serve. On hard court, the average first serve for men is 115 mph and the average first serve for women is 99 mph.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we think of the best ralliers in the game, we are thinking of the players who not only have a penchant for extended points but also win those points. While tournaments will sometimes tell us about typical rally lengths, we don&amp;rsquo;t usually know how a player&amp;rsquo;s chances of winning a point vary with rally length. In this post, I look into this question using Australian Open statistics provided by the Game Insight Group of Tennis Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Rally lengths are a useful measure for differentiating styles of play. Players who tend to keep points to a few shots would be expected to be dominant on serve and more willing to go to net. Players who tend to grind out extended rallies would tend to be the baseliners whose best weapons are their groundstrokes and endurance.
Some analysts have characterised the professional game as first strike tennis, because the majority of points are 4 shots or fewer (counting the serve).</description>

      <description>In my last post I discussed the idea of return pressure and suggested that it could be measured by looking at the amount of time a receiver gives the server to prepare for their second shot. Players who exert more pressure with their return of serve are expected to get a quicker jump on the ball and make a more powerful shot inside the baseline.
In this post I want to focus on one part of that equation, the quick jump, by looking at reaction times on the serve return.</description>

      <description>The tennis world is gearing up for the ATP World Tour Finals, where 8 of the best male players will vie for the final major title of 2016. One of the things that could be decisive in who advances to the semifinals is the pressure of the return. Here, when I refer to return pressure, I am thinking of the kind of player who jumps on the serve and makes an attacking shot that gives the server little time to react.</description>

      <description>The Masters in Bercy continues concerns over Novak Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s form going into the Tour Finals. With the loss to Marin Cilic in Paris and Andy Murray one win away from taking the World No. 1 spot, the 2016 season has raised many questions about Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s performance. While we see the indicators of a slump from his win record, we can&amp;rsquo;t know whether and how his game has actually changed&amp;mdash; has he lost effectiveness on serve?</description>

      <description>This week continues the rollout of a collection of new statistics describing the quality of shots in tennis. Last week began with a look at groundstroke speeds, focusing on the backhand. This week we turn to the accuracy of groundstrokes and look specifically at how frequently shots land close to the line.
Whether a ball lands close to a line is obviously a subjective call. In the summaries that follow, I will use 3 ball lengths (approximately 21 cm) as &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe that it is only a few months before the start of the 2017 ATP and WTA seasons. Preparations for the 2017 AO in Melbourne are already in high gear. There will be a lot of developments you can expect to see come January, including some new stats using Hawk-Eye ball and player tracking data. These stats were developed by Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group&amp;mdash; a team of scientists TA has brought together to advance the use of analytics in tennis. As a data scientist for the GIG, I wanted to preview these developments and some of the things we are learning from tracking data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few posts, I have been applying a new metric &lt;em&gt;clutch averages&lt;/em&gt; to the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s singles matches at the 2016 U.S. Open. The purpose of these averages is to focus on how players tend to perform on the most important points in a match. In this way, these stats can help us to find out which players win the majority of the most important points? And which players are most and least affected by the scoreline?&lt;/p&gt;

This week I do the same review for the men. As before, the clutch performance represented here is the summary of the most important points won on serve (Figure 1) and return (Figure 2). These summaries include big points like break points, of course, but also factors in other important points &amp;ndash; like tiebreak points or 30-all situations late in a set. In each case, the score situation is weighed by its relative importance, which is its expected influence on a win or loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The 2016 U.S. Open might now be a faint memory of the news cycle but there are still plenty of stories about player performance that were never told. This week, I have been digging into the point-by-point data from this year&amp;rsquo;s matches at Flushing to find out how players handled the biggest moments of the tournament.
I have talked before about how we can use a point&amp;rsquo;s importance to identify who are the most clutch performers in the sport.</description>

      <description>The final day of the 2016 U.S. Open brought us the 26th meeting of Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka. Djokovic has built up such a win record in recent years that, even at the final stage of a Grand Slam against as formidable an opponent as World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka, he was still the favorite by far. FiveThirtyEight predictions gave the World No. 1 an 88% chance of winning his 13th Major title.</description>

      <description>After a day of women&amp;rsquo;s semifinals that saw the exit and dethroning of World No. 1 Serena Williams, the favorites in the men&amp;rsquo;s semifinals had to be on guard when they stepped onto court today. The first match of the day pitted a fresh Novak Djokovic against showman and crowd favorite Gael Monfils. The day was be closed out by the matchup of Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka. Both matches were hard-fought and delivered a packed highlight reel.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shocks keep coming at the U.S. Open. After Kei Nishikori&amp;rsquo;s surprising upset of Andy Murray in the quarterfinals of Day 10, Day 11 brought us another massive upset. Today it was Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; turn to exit the tournament, as Karolina Pliskova denied her a 23rd major title. After the loss to Roberta Vinci at the 2015 U.S. Open, this makes for back-to-back disappointments for Williams.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Today wrapped up the last half of the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s quarterfinals of the 2016 U.S. Open. Two of the favorites for the title&amp;mdash;Serena Williams and Andy Murray&amp;mdash;were on center stage. Serena Williams was tested by a determined Simona Halep but would eventually make it through. Andy Murray, on the other hand, would fall in 5 to Japanese No 1. Kei Nishikori. Here are visual summaries of how those and the two other quarterfinal matches of the day were decided.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 9 brought us the first half of the quarterfinals of the 2016 U.S. Open. It was a day when the favorites were in top-form, closing out all of their matches in swift fashion. Here we review how both the two women&amp;rsquo;s and two men&amp;rsquo;s quarterfinal matches of the day were won.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 7, the last day of week 1 at the 2016 U.S. Open, saw the losses of two Americans (Keys and Sock), the upset of a favorite for the men&amp;rsquo;s title (Nadal), and the resurgence of a former World No. 1 (Wozniacki). Below are the point-by-point win prediction charts for 4 of the most interesting wins in the first half of Round 4.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are nearing the end of the first day of Round 3 and the surprises continue. There were some big wins and near big losses for the players at Flushing today. In this post, I will look at the point-by-point predictions for 5 of the day&amp;rsquo;s tightest matches. By looking over the charts of the match-in-progress can help us appreciate how a match was won and what some of the most shocking wins of the day were.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final day of Round 2 at the 2016 U.S. Open brought some more upsets and nail-biting battles. I have selected 6 of the most contested matches of the day and created point-by-point prediction charts to track the ebbs and flows of each. The expectations for each match are based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-us-open-tennis-predictions/mens/&#34;&gt;player Elo ratings&lt;/a&gt;. These ratings tells us how capable a player should be of winning a match against their drawn opponent if both players are playing to their expected ability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Round 2 of the 2016 U.S. Open, an American served up what could turn out to be one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Ryan Harrison, ranked 220 in the world and known mostly for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/at-wimbledon-ryan-harrison-suffers-again-from-his-bad-luck-of-the-draw/&#34;&gt;streak of unlucky draws&lt;/a&gt; at Grand Slams, defeated huge-hitting World No. 6 Milos Raonic 6-7 (4), 7-5, 7-5, 6-1.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have gotten through the first round and already the 2016 U.S. Open has given us a number of epics. One of those was the all-American matchup of Jack Sock and Taylor Fritz, a match that was highlighted in the clutch preview &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2016/08/29/US-Open-Mens-First-Round-Preview/&#34;&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first round of the main draw of the 2016 US Open begins today. If you are like me you have spent a good part of the weekend digesting the draw and making predictions about which matches could be the most interesting to come out of Flushing Meadows. In this post, I want to highlight a few of the matches that stood out to me. In doing so, I also want to introduce a new way of looking at recent form with something I call &lt;strong&gt;clutch averaging&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As with the men&amp;rsquo;s preview, I have selected among matches of players who have some match history and have reported. For each match, clutch summary statistics of the players&amp;rsquo; last meeting and most recent result are shown.</description>

      <description>In statistics, an expectation is a way to quantify what is typical or likely. And, when we compare what actually happened against what was expected, we have a way to judge how surprised or unimpressed we should be.
Despite their usefulness, you are as likely to see a probabilistic expectation in tennis as you are a floral pattern at Wimbledon. Mainstream tennis stats only report what happened, not what was likely to happen.</description>

      <description>One of the many things I miss after the dissolution of Bill Simmons&amp;rsquo; sports blog Grantland is Kirk Goldsberry&amp;rsquo;s NBA shot charts. The classic version of the Goldsberry shot chart is a plot of hexagonal bins showing the locations and frequency of where a player takes shots overlaid onto a representation of the basketball court. Combined with heavy annotation and a lot of style, the charts are both effective at communicating shot tendencies and a pure pleasure to read (an example for Steph Curry is shown to the right).</description>

      <description>July has been a stellar month for British player Johanna Konta. After defeating one of her idols, Venus Williams, to win a Premier title at Stanford, Konta will play today for a spot in the semifinal of the Rogers Cup.
Embed from Getty Images This month, Konta just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to lose. When players hit a streak like Konta has, it can sometime seem like winning becomes inevitable, as if with each win added to their record the next win becomes even more likely.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2016 Wimbledon Championships brought us a number of stories and memorable matches. But, with the third round exit of Novak Djokovic, we &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; get to see a semifinal between Djokovic and Federer. We will have to wait a few more weeks for the arrival of the US Open for the next opportunity to see if Federer can still test Djokovic on a slam stage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a sad day for Federer fans. After a glorious comeback from two sets down in the quarterfinals, Federer&amp;rsquo;s bid for an eighth Wimbledon title was cut short by big-serving Milos Raonic on Friday.
Like most close matches, the margins separating Federer and Raonic were tiny. With 70% of points won on serve and 29% of points won on return, Federer was just one percentage point behind the Canadian star on both skills.</description>

      <description>One of the matches we can look forward to&amp;mdash;rain or shine&amp;mdash;on Day 6 of the Wimbledon Championships is World No. 2 Andy Murray against Aussie John Millman. Murray&amp;rsquo;s run at Wimbledon is an especially interesting one because it is the first Grand Slam since Murray&amp;rsquo;s reunion with legend coach Ivan Lendl. The on-again off-again partnership provides an interesting natural experiment of the &amp;ldquo;coach effect&amp;rdquo; and gives us one more reason to look back at one of my favorite tennis memes of all time.</description>

      <description>Choking is one of the most fascinating phenomena in sport. 2016 provided us with a spectacular example of a choke when Jordan Spieth made a quadruple-bogey on hole 12 of the Augusta Masters, setting into motion the loss of a near-certain win on the final day on those hallowed links.
Although we may not ever see a meltdown of that magnitude again for years to come, it still serves as a reminder of the role of pressure in competition.</description>

On the women&amp;rsquo;s side, twenty-two year old Garbiñe Muguruza, a rising star with only one previous appearance in a Grand Slam final, thwarted Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; third bid at her twenty-second title to her first major win.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zebra prints and back-to-back matches haven&amp;rsquo;t been the only strange things to appear at this year&amp;rsquo;s French Open. The washout that has been a catastrophe for the 2016 Roland Garros schedule has created a myriad of unusual pressures and demands for the players (and a few of them have been vocal about their dislike of the situation). As a consequence of all this, player adaptability and grit have taken higher places in the list of skills needed to advance to the next round than would be the case in drier conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

With only 2 2016 clay court titles among the top 4 seeds on the women&amp;rsquo;s side and Serena Williams without a major title since last year&amp;rsquo;s Wimbledon, it&amp;rsquo;s looking like anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess over which WTA player will walk away with the Roland Garros title in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After Novak Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s surprising early exit last month at the Monte Carlo Masters tournament, this week it was Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s turn. His first clay court event since Monte Carlo was brought to a decisive halt when he lost to Dominic Thiem in the third round at the Rome Masters.
Now any player can have an off day, especially when coming back from injury. But when it happens to the best players in the game, it&amp;rsquo;s often the source of alarm.</description>

      <description>After two close semifinals, World No. 2 Andy Murray is set to defend his Madrid Masters title against top seed Novak Djokovic. The fact that the two go into the match at the top of the ATP rankings leaderboard suggests that we are in store for a quality match, with Djokovic being the perennial favorite.
But what exactly does the difference of one position in ranking really tell us about the expected quality of play?</description>

But the tables quickly turned and after taking the second sets in 6-2 and 6-3, Thiem ultimately prevailed, securing a spot in the final against Philipp Kohlschreiber.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The break-heavy clay court season continued in the men&amp;rsquo;s semifinal match where World No. 5 Rafael Nadal faced-off against 31st-ranked Fabio Fognini. There were a total of 8 breaks in the match, 4 in each set. There were also two of the most frustrating of break phenomena, the back-to-back break. The first came in the fifth game of the first set, when Fognini broke Nadal&amp;rsquo;s serve and put himself on the scoreboard for the first time.</description>

      <description>With the second round exit of Novak Djokovic and the quarterfinal loss of Roger Federer, the finals of the 2016 Monte Carlo Masters brought us a pairing we might not have expected on Day 1, but a thrilling one nonetheless. The first two sets between Rafael Nadal and Gael Monfils on Sunday were as tightly contested as the fans that withstood a rainy morning in Monaco could have hoped for.</description>

      <description>Raymond Moore&amp;rsquo;s display of sexism at this year&amp;rsquo;s BNP Paribas Open put a more intense spotlight on gender equality in tennis than any of us were expecting. The processing of his statements and resignation as tournament director prompted some insightful perspective-taking by former and current players. At the same time, it also encouraged more of the same old pitting of the WTA and ATP tours against each other.
With this backdrop in mind, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but cringe when I read myth 6 of Klaasseen and Magnus: &amp;lsquo;the probability that the service is in is the same in men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s singles&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The 5th myth in Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s examination of some of the most common beliefs in tennis puts point importance at center stage once again. With myth 5, K&amp;amp;M ask if there is any truth to the idea that all points in tennis are equally important.
Of all of the 22 beliefs that K&amp;amp;M consider in Analyzing Wimbledon this is the one that probably has the least traction in the tennis community.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth myth in the countdown of Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s 22 myths of tennis is &lt;em&gt;the myth of the seventh game&lt;/em&gt;.

The 10th anniversary of the two-day nerd fest attracted 3,900 attendees and some of the heaviest hitters in sports stats, including Bill James, Nate Silver, and Mike Zarren.
One of the traditional features of Sloan is the research competition. In true sporting fashion, this is a multi-stage, single-elimination tournament that pits the top research innovations in sports analytics against each other.</description>

      <description>The next myth in our look back at Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s takedown of 22 tennis myths is Myth 3. This myth concerns the importance of points and whether each point is equally important to the server and returner.
Myth 3: &amp;ldquo;Every point (game, set) is equally important to both players&amp;rdquo; In Analyzing Wimbledon Klaassen and Magnus make the logically argument that a point is always equally important to the server and receiver.</description>

      <description>The second myth addressed in Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s instant classic of tennis analysis, Analyzing Wimbledon, is the myth of serving first in a match.
Myth 2: &amp;ldquo;Is there an advantage to serve first in a set?&amp;rdquo; The coin toss is one of those pre-match rituals that many of us fast-forward through. If you can recall any occasion when you have stopped to watch the coin toss, there is a very good chance that the player who won the toss opted to serve.</description>

      <description>Books on tennis statistics are as rare as black swans. So I take notice whenever one appears.
One of the most recent of these scarce creatures is Franc Klaassen and Jan Magnus&amp;rsquo;s Analyzing Wimbledon. Despite having primary appointments in economic departments, Klaassen and Magnus have produced some of the most scholarly mathematical papers on tennis. Analyzing Wimbledon is a compilation of the findings that have come out of their long partnership, synthesized into a list of 22 myths of tennis.</description>

Still, every year the data the sport gathers and makes available to the public is way too basic. You know those end-of-match summaries with the simple counts of first serve points, second serve points, etc.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend we closed the chapter on the first Grand Slam of 2016. As all our  news feeds overflowed with the photos of the tournament champions Novak Djokovic and first-time major winner, Angelique Kerber, in the hours that followed their victories, each snapshot was a reminder of how much can happen in just two weeks time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After solidifying a career best season with the win of the ATP Tour Finals, definitive World No. 1 Novak Djokovic set the tennis world chattering about where his 2015 season stood in the history of best tennis seasons. It is fitting for these discussions that Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s last win of 2015 was over Roger Federer, the current World No. 3 whose achievements in the mid 2000s have often been argued to be some of the greatest in the Open Era.</description>

      <description>Last week I asked whether WAR, a comprehensive statistic of player value, has a place in tennis. Although WAR was developed for and has been primarily used in team sports to estimate a player&amp;rsquo;s contribution to team wins, its potential applications are much broader. WAR, in its most general sense, is about giving perspective to a player&amp;rsquo;s performance by comparing the outcomes of a player&amp;rsquo;s outings to a common standard: the replacement player.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If, based on the title of this post, you were expecting some kind of jingoistic fantasy of tennis players armed with bazookas, you were mistaken. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that kind of war (as much as &lt;em&gt;ESPN&lt;/em&gt; might be interested in such a gladiatorial venture); it&amp;rsquo;s about the sabermetric kind of WAR.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the questions that most intrigued me is whether, as the title of the article suggests, any one person can &amp;ldquo;revolutionize&amp;rdquo; how we experience sports?</description>

      <description>Last week I openly admitted to a new obsession with break points, which has lead me down a path of investigations to try to understand the role of break points for winning in tennis. One product to come out of this is the concept of break point decisiveness, which I define as the percentage of matches in which the winner also won more break points than the loser. My last post showed that break point decisiveness ranges from 87 to 91% for the ATP, depending on which surface and match format (best of 3 or best of 5) is being played.</description>

      <description>As part of the work I have been doing on the Pythagorean model for wins in tennis, I have&amp;mdash;in-between MLB playoffs and the Shanghai Masters, in any case&amp;mdash;been thinking a lot about break points lately.
We all know break points are important. If a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t edge out his or her opponent&amp;rsquo;s break points won in a set, the set (and ultimately the match) will have to be decided in a tiebreak or, when a tiebreak isn&amp;rsquo;t in place, a match could go on ad infinitum as some of us thought might happen when big servers Isner and Mahut butted heads in the 2010 Wimbledon first round.</description>

      <description>Last week, based on work presented at the 2015 NESSIS, I wrote about an extension of Pythagorean Expectation to tennis, which showed that break point conversion has a strikingly similar ability to predict match wins in tennis as runs predict team wins in baseball. The Pythagorean analyses were based only on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. In this post, thanks to match statistics published by Jeff Sackmann of Tennis Abstract, I will examine the existence of a Pythagorean formula for women&amp;rsquo;s tennis.</description>

      <description>In the short life of this blog, I have, on several occasions, complained about the lack of analytics in tennis. But what evidence is there to back up this view? One place to start to unpack the state of analytics in tennis is by comparison to other major sports that are at the forefront of the analytics revolution. In this article I want to discuss one gap that such a comparison reveals&amp;mdash; the lack of metrics for win expectation.</description>

      <description>With the existence of Hawkeye and the IBM Slamtracker, tennis fans might be under the impression that the CPUs of tennis analysts are overflowing with high-quality stroke-by-stroke data on today&amp;rsquo;s matches. Regrettably, this is far from the truth. The data that drives the most interesting visualizations during a broadcasts, like summaries of the frequency of shots by their position on court, or the data behind the Challenge System are under the proprietary control of a few corporate giants (IBM for the Slams, SAP for the WTA), which means they are also out-of-reach of tennis researchers.</description>

Since that match, Federer has reached the finals of 5 other Grand Slams but has not won a title since his 2012 victory at Wimbledon over Andy Murray. Following that title win, he has advanced to a final at two Slams, the 2014 and 2015 Wimbledon Championships; in each case, losing to Novak Djokovic.</description>

When Vinci stepped onto Ashe yesterday, the task before her must have seemed unthinkable. She had never won a set against Williams in their 4 previous meetings, and all of their prior matches were before the semifinal round, when Williams&amp;rsquo; is known not to play at her highest level.</description>

      <description>At the 2015 US Open, IBM is continuing its long partnership with the USTA to bring tennis fans &amp;ldquo;more than the score&amp;rdquo;. One of the main ways that Big Blue is going beyond the score is with their Keys to the Match&amp;ndash;basically, a dashboard with performance targets for a given head-to-head.
If you are like me and have ever perused the Keys on a changeover over player bathroom break, you might have wondered exactly what insights they contain.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heat was the main topic of discussion on Day 4 of the US Open. The brutal effects of sweltering temperatures and stifling humidity took centerstage during the afternoon play when American Jack Sock collapsed in the third set of his match against Ruben Bemelmans. Sock&amp;ndash;who looked unconscious as the medical team on site rushed to his aid&amp;ndash;was forced to retire and was subsequently diagnosed with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/09/03/american-tennis-player-jack-sock-collapses-on-court-at-u-s-open/&#34;&gt;heat illness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Day 4 of the 2015 US Open and the tournament has already brought a lot of surprises. While we all might have expected Nick Kyrgios to exit with flare in the first round, few of us would have anticipated that the first round would say farewell to so many of the seeds. The ladies&amp;rsquo; draw feels especially bare after 11 of 32 seeds (34%) did not advance to the second round&amp;ndash;Stephens (29), Pavlyuchenkova (31), Pliskova (8), Kuznetsova (30), Suarez Navarro (10), Jankovic (21), Ivanovic (7), Safarova (6), Begu (28), Bacsinszky (14), Cornet (27).</description>

      <title>Serena Williams’ Only Obstacle to a Calendar Slam is Herself</title>
      <link>https://skoval.github.io/2015/08/31/serena-williams-only-obstacle/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a 21-minute opening match at the US Open that ended with her opponent&amp;rsquo;s retirement, Serena Williams is now 6 victories from her first Calendar Slam and 22nd career major title, tying her with Steffi Graf for the woman with the most Slam titles in the Open Era. Williams comes to Flushing Methods with a season match record of 48 wins to 2 losses—a record so close to perfection that you couldn’t blame her if she strutted onto Arthur Ashe and talked trash on a changeover or two (young Aussies, take note). But don’t expect Williams to rock swag until the Open trophy is sitting securely in her hands. As much as the wins keep coming, the queen of the court’s confidence has been in a perplexing slump.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The most surprising runs of all time on the ATP Denis Shapovalov surprised the tennis world in Montreal by reaching the semi finals in stunning fashion, beating Del Potro and Nadal back-to-back. This made me wonder: was this one of the most surprising runs ever in tennis?
To try to answer this question, I look at the likelihood of players&amp;rsquo; runs under Elo. The likelihood is simply the probabilities of multiple events multiplied together.</description>
