      <description>The French Open draw is out and Round 1 is only hours away. Four of the names that will be watched closely on the men&amp;rsquo;s side are 9-time champion Rafael Nadal, defending champion Novak Djokovic, defending finalist Andy Murray, and aspiring title-contender Dominic Thiem.
Embed from Getty Images I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a look at the clay court performance of each of these four so far in 2017. In this post, I want to take a bigger step back and bring more context to each player&amp;rsquo;s clay court performance as they prepare for their first matches in Paris.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I took a look at the clay-court serve performance of four of the ATP players most in contention for the 2017 Roland Garros title&amp;mdash; Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. That analysis showed that Rafael Nadal has so far separated himself on serve by 5 to 15 percentage points on average. An impressive stat next to anyone but especially when compared to the players who are some of his toughest rivals for another Major win.</description>

      <description>Now that the dust has settled at the Rome Masters, the tennis world is turning its focus to the French Open, where main draw play is nearly upon us. With Roger Federer skipping Roland Garros when not injured for the first time since he first played the event in 1999, the four names that will be most in the discussion for the win are Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.</description>

      <description>In her first match at the Rome Masters, World No. 1 Kerber was ousted by
the 68th ranked player on tour, Anett Kontaveit, in straight sets. Despite holding the best rank on tour, Kerber has seemed in a slump for most of the season with early round loses becoming a norm.
Embed from Getty Images Kerber&amp;rsquo;s loss continues an undesirable streak for No. 1 seeds in the 2017 WTA season. Look across the 11 results at Premier-level events or better this year and you will not find a single No.</description>

      <description>At this point in the clay season, many of us were expecting Andy Murray to have appeared in at least one or more finals and maybe even snagged a title. But with a Round of 16 loss this week to Borna Coric at the Mutua Madrid Open, Murray has crashed out earlier than expected for his third clay court event of the season.
By all accounts Murray&amp;rsquo;s clay results in 2017 have been disappointing.</description>

      <description>Every match win involves some luck. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the coin toss or the bounce off a clipped net, some events in a tennis match are outside of a player&amp;rsquo;s control. And the sport accepts that. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept it when it comes to line calls, especially when there is technology that can prevent line call errors.
It is hard to find a better recent example of the frustration of a bad call than the overrule in the semifinal of the Monte Carlo Masters two weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Embed from Getty Images Despite starting the 2017 season as World No. 1 for the first time in his career, Andy Murray has had a lackluster go of it so far. After Murray&amp;rsquo;s Round of 16 loss at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, his match record was 13 and 4. Now, in terms of wins and losses alone, that puts him on par with his performances thru the end of April in 2016 and 2014, but far behind his record in 2015 when he had bagged 23 wins and just 5 losses by this point in the calendar.</description>

      <description>The tennis world is abuzz with speculation over the future of Serena Williams. In an already extraordinary week in which the 23 Grand Slam title-owning champion was projected to reclaim the World No. 1 without having played an event since this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open, Williams, in a cheeky snapchat post, announced that she was expecting.
Embed from Getty Images If current reports are accurate, Williams is 20 weeks along this week, which means she was 8 weeks pregnant at the time she won the 2017 Australian Open, joining Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong as some of the few women who have been at the top of professional tennis while with child.</description>

      <description>With less than 2 weeks until Maria Sharapova makes her return, there is a growing stir of speculation over her comeback. Having already been granted controversial wild cards and 3 Premier events, including the upcoming Stuttgart Grand Prix, Sharapova&amp;mdash;after 15 months out of the game&amp;mdash;will return to tennis with a unique opportunity to avoid the usual entry prohibitions of unranked players. Her first match will be in the middle of the first round of Stuttgart on April 26th where she will have a chance to take 470 ranking points.</description>

      <description>After the first quarter of the 2017 season, Roger Federer has his 18th Grand Slam title and a 19-1 win record overall. Such an impressive start naturally leads us to ask: Where should we rank Federer&amp;rsquo;s 2017 start against the other seasons of his career? How does it compare to the best season starts in tennis history?
Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group has scoured the first three months of the men&amp;rsquo;s Open Era to try to shed light on these questions.</description>

      <description>With all but the final round of the 2017 Miami Open decided, it&amp;rsquo;s time to look back at some of the most impressive performances at the second Masters event of the season. Here, we measure impressiveness by how clutch a player was throughout the event.
Clutch performance weighs points with more pressure and more importance to the match more heavily than less important points. This is different from typical match statistics that treat all points as equally important, giving the same weight, for instance, to the first point of the match as the set-deciding point of a tiebreak.</description>

      <description>With modern tracking data, it is possible to get an almost continuous representation of the locations of both the ball and players during a tennis match. The richness of these data is a huge boon for tennis research but it comes with some challenges too. A lot of my time these days is spent thinking about how best to visualise this information.
Because time and flow are inherent parts of tennis data, animation is a natural choice for visualization.</description>

      <description>If tennis fans thought Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open win over Rafael Nadal was a fluke in an otherwise lopsided head-to-head, Federer&amp;rsquo;s devastating victory over Nadal this week at the Indian Wells Masters was a clear message that the AO won&amp;rsquo;t be a one-off for his 2017 season.
Embed from Getty Images In his straight-set desert victory, Federer needed just a little over an hour to get into the quarterfinals. Giving no break points to Nadal while converting 4 of 5 break point opportunities himself, Federer made surviving the &amp;ldquo;Group of Death&amp;rdquo; look easy.</description>

      <description>Last week, the sports analytics world descended on Boston for the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC). Co-founded by Daryl Morey, general manager for the Houston Rockets&amp;mdash;a team that, during his tenure, has shaped its identity around its relentless and often innovative use of stats&amp;mdash;SSAC has become one of the most popular events for academics and hobbyists to share cutting edge research in sports data science.
 Sounds really nerdy but the analytics revolution in sport has made the event a must-do for a growing list of sports celebs, including Billy Beane, John Urschel, and Sam Hinkie.</description>

      <description>With all of the tiers that exist on the professional tennis circuit, from 10K events up to the Majors, I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered how tournament tiers should be factored into Elo predictions and whether some events should be excluded entirely. The standard Elo gives players a bigger boost (10% exactly) for wins at Majors but treats wins against similar opponents at any other event the same.
Most of the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Elo I have used ratings that were based on 250 events and above (International and above for women).</description>

      <description>Last week I began to take a look at error patterns with tennis Elo predictions. The question of interest was how does serve advantage influence Elo performance?
Looking at Elo error rates against a player&amp;rsquo;s average serve performance in a year showed the most error for average servers. In this post, I want to look at serve performance at events and in matches to better understand how Elo performs across services and for better or worse servers.</description>

      <description>With only two of the top 8 seeds reaching the quarterfinals at the first Grand Slam of the year, the 2017 Australian Open was a trainwreck for most prediction models. Even the Elo forecasting system, one of the most accurate open prediction approaches in tennis, couldn&amp;rsquo;t have anticipated the unusual conditions of this year&amp;rsquo;s Major down under.
Or could it have?
We know that one of the contributing factors for the higher number of upsets at the Australian Open was a higher than normal serve percentage.</description>

      <description>If you are like me, you are spending the day after the final match of the 2017 Australian Open looking for ways to relive the startling 35th meeting of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. At the start of the tournament, the chances that Federer would win the title were just 3%; Nadal was an even greater underdog with just 1.5%. Seeing either of them in the final match at Rod Laver Arena wasn&amp;rsquo;t suppose to happen.</description>

      <description>Even with the men&amp;rsquo;s final still to come, we can already say that the 2017 Australian Open brought more surprises than anyone expected. As much as we will be focused on the surprise of another Williams sister final and the 35th meeting of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overlook the less familiar names that impressed us at the first Slam of the season.
Since it is sometimes hard to look back at two weeks of matchplay and pick out the performances that surprised us most, I was thinking how you might try to put a number to &amp;ldquo;improvement&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>We are looking forward to two classic finals in the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s events at this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open. The men&amp;rsquo;s matchup will be the 35th meeting of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer and their 22nd meeting in a tournament final.
Embed from Getty Images Nadal earned his spot in the final by prevailing over an on-the-rise Grigor Dimitrov in a spectacular five-set, four-hour plus semifinal. There were many takeaways from that match but the one that stood out most to me when thinking about the upcoming final was Nadal&amp;rsquo;s serve patterns.</description>

      <description>With the prospect of a Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer final at this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open, many are probably wondering if we are in store for the relatively speedy match when they last played here in 2014 or an epic more like their four-hour plus semifinal at the 2012 AO. There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much that is predictable about this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open. One had to be clairvoyant to have picked a Nadal-Federer final (if that turns out to be what we get) let alone how long such a meeting could last.</description>

With the exits of the top seeds on the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s draws in a single day, thanks to the phenomenal play of Mischa Zverev and Coco Vandeweghe, many of us are now wondering if the 2017 Australian Open is the most random in history?</description>

      <description>One of the curious things about tennis is that every seeded player&amp;rsquo;s path to the title is different. When the champions are hoisting a tournament trophy over their heads, we largely ignore the role that luck might have played in their victory. But should it be ignored? And how much of a role does luck play anyway?

One of the players that tennis fans will be expecting the most from is the recently knighted Sir Andy Murray. Not just because of the knighthood but because of last year&amp;rsquo;s miraculous season that propelled that honour and saw Murray do the impossible: take the World No. 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I took a look at the distances covered in matches and points for male players. The stats from Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group showed that men at the Australian Open travel 2 to 3 miles per match and the big servers of the game tend to travel the least of all players.
But what about the women&amp;rsquo;s tour? What are the typical distances for them and who are the biggest movers?</description>

      <description>One of the ways that the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s games differ the most is the serve. While previous posts on this site have shown that the speeds of men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s groundstrokes are actually fairly comparable, the men separate themselves by far on serve. On hard court, the average first serve for men is 115 mph and the average first serve for women is 99 mph.

      <description>When we think of the best ralliers in the game, we are thinking of the players who not only have a penchant for extended points but also win those points. While tournaments will sometimes tell us about typical rally lengths, we don&amp;rsquo;t usually know how a player&amp;rsquo;s chances of winning a point vary with rally length. In this post, I look into this question using Australian Open statistics provided by the Game Insight Group of Tennis Australia.</description>

      <description>Rally lengths are a useful measure for differentiating styles of play. Players who tend to keep points to a few shots would be expected to be dominant on serve and more willing to go to net. Players who tend to grind out extended rallies would tend to be the baseliners whose best weapons are their groundstrokes and endurance.
Some analysts have characterised the professional game as first strike tennis, because the majority of points are 4 shots or fewer (counting the serve).</description>

Most male players reach average speeds of 71 to 83 mph on the forehand (Figure 1). Though there weren&amp;rsquo;t many deep forehand shots observed for American Jack Sock, he did have the highest average speed at 86 mph.</description>

      <description>In my last post I discussed the idea of return pressure and suggested that it could be measured by looking at the amount of time a receiver gives the server to prepare for their second shot. Players who exert more pressure with their return of serve are expected to get a quicker jump on the ball and make a more powerful shot inside the baseline.
In this post I want to focus on one part of that equation, the quick jump, by looking at reaction times on the serve return.</description>

      <description>The tennis world is gearing up for the ATP World Tour Finals, where 8 of the best male players will vie for the final major title of 2016. One of the things that could be decisive in who advances to the semifinals is the pressure of the return. Here, when I refer to return pressure, I am thinking of the kind of player who jumps on the serve and makes an attacking shot that gives the server little time to react.</description>

      <description>This week continues the rollout of a collection of new statistics describing the quality of shots in tennis. Last week began with a look at groundstroke speeds, focusing on the backhand. This week we turn to the accuracy of groundstrokes and look specifically at how frequently shots land close to the line.
Whether a ball lands close to a line is obviously a subjective call. In the summaries that follow, I will use 3 ball lengths (approximately 21 cm) as &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>On the first day of Round 2 of the 2016 U.S. Open, an American served up what could turn out to be one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Ryan Harrison, ranked 220 in the world and known mostly for a streak of unlucky draws at Grand Slams, defeated huge-hitting World No. 6 Milos Raonic 6-7 (4), 7-5, 7-5, 6-1.

      <description>We have gotten through the first round and already the 2016 U.S. Open has given us a number of epics. One of those was the all-American matchup of Jack Sock and Taylor Fritz, a match that was highlighted in the clutch preview on this blog.

      <description>The first round of the main draw of the 2016 US Open begins today. If you are like me you have spent a good part of the weekend digesting the draw and making predictions about which matches could be the most interesting to come out of Flushing Meadows. In this post, I want to highlight a few of the matches that stood out to me. In doing so, I also want to introduce a new way of looking at recent form with something I call clutch averaging.</description>

      <description>In statistics, an expectation is a way to quantify what is typical or likely. And, when we compare what actually happened against what was expected, we have a way to judge how surprised or unimpressed we should be.
Despite their usefulness, you are as likely to see a probabilistic expectation in tennis as you are a floral pattern at Wimbledon. Mainstream tennis stats only report what happened, not what was likely to happen.</description>

      <description>One of the many things I miss after the dissolution of Bill Simmons&amp;rsquo; sports blog Grantland is Kirk Goldsberry&amp;rsquo;s NBA shot charts. The classic version of the Goldsberry shot chart is a plot of hexagonal bins showing the locations and frequency of where a player takes shots overlaid onto a representation of the basketball court. Combined with heavy annotation and a lot of style, the charts are both effective at communicating shot tendencies and a pure pleasure to read (an example for Steph Curry is shown to the right).</description>

      <description>The 2016 Wimbledon Championships brought us a number of stories and memorable matches. But, with the third round exit of Novak Djokovic, we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see a semifinal between Djokovic and Federer. We will have to wait a few more weeks for the arrival of the US Open for the next opportunity to see if Federer can still test Djokovic on a slam stage.
 Any one with an interest in numbers will especially want to see a rematch of the 2015 US Open men&amp;rsquo;s final.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a sad day for Federer fans. After a glorious comeback from two sets down in the quarterfinals, Federer&amp;rsquo;s bid for an eighth Wimbledon title was cut short by big-serving Milos Raonic on Friday.
Like most close matches, the margins separating Federer and Raonic were tiny. With 70% of points won on serve and 29% of points won on return, Federer was just one percentage point behind the Canadian star on both skills.</description>

      <description>One of the matches we can look forward to&amp;mdash;rain or shine&amp;mdash;on Day 6 of the Wimbledon Championships is World No. 2 Andy Murray against Aussie John Millman. Murray&amp;rsquo;s run at Wimbledon is an especially interesting one because it is the first Grand Slam since Murray&amp;rsquo;s reunion with legend coach Ivan Lendl. The on-again off-again partnership provides an interesting natural experiment of the &amp;ldquo;coach effect&amp;rdquo; and gives us one more reason to look back at one of my favorite tennis memes of all time.</description>

      <description>Choking is one of the most fascinating phenomena in sport. 2016 provided us with a spectacular example of a choke when Jordan Spieth made a quadruple-bogey on hole 12 of the Augusta Masters, setting into motion the loss of a near-certain win on the final day on those hallowed links.
Although we may not ever see a meltdown of that magnitude again for years to come, it still serves as a reminder of the role of pressure in competition.</description>

      <description>Zebra prints and back-to-back matches haven&amp;rsquo;t been the only strange things to appear at this year&amp;rsquo;s French Open. The washout that has been a catastrophe for the 2016 Roland Garros schedule has created a myriad of unusual pressures and demands for the players (and a few of them have been vocal about their dislike of the situation). As a consequence of all this, player adaptability and grit have taken higher places in the list of skills needed to advance to the next round than would be the case in drier conditions.</description>

With only 2 2016 clay court titles among the top 4 seeds on the women&amp;rsquo;s side and Serena Williams without a major title since last year&amp;rsquo;s Wimbledon, it&amp;rsquo;s looking like anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess over which WTA player will walk away with the Roland Garros title in two weeks.</description>

      <description>After Novak Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s surprising early exit last month at the Monte Carlo Masters tournament, this week it was Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s turn. His first clay court event since Monte Carlo was brought to a decisive halt when he lost to Dominic Thiem in the third round at the Rome Masters.

The fact that the two go into the match at the top of the ATP rankings leaderboard suggests that we are in store for a quality match, with Djokovic being the perennial favorite.

There were a total of 8 breaks in the match, 4 in each set. There were also two of the most frustrating of break phenomena, the back-to-back break.

      <description>Raymond Moore&amp;rsquo;s display of sexism at this year&amp;rsquo;s BNP Paribas Open put a more intense spotlight on gender equality in tennis than any of us were expecting. The processing of his statements and resignation as tournament director prompted some insightful perspective-taking by former and current players. At the same time, it also encouraged more of the same old pitting of the WTA and ATP tours against each other.
With this backdrop in mind, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but cringe when I read myth 6 of Klaasseen and Magnus: &amp;lsquo;the probability that the service is in is the same in men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s singles&amp;rsquo;.</description>

If you can recall any occasion when you have stopped to watch the coin toss, there is a very good chance that the player who won the toss opted to serve.</description>

      <description>Books on tennis statistics are as rare as black swans. So I take notice whenever one appears.
One of the most recent of these scarce creatures is Franc Klaassen and Jan Magnus&amp;rsquo;s Analyzing Wimbledon. Despite having primary appointments in economic departments, Klaassen and Magnus have produced some of the most scholarly mathematical papers on tennis. Analyzing Wimbledon is a compilation of the findings that have come out of their long partnership, synthesized into a list of 22 myths of tennis.</description>

      <description>We are just a little more than a month into the 2016 tennis season. With 10 months of matches, 3 Grand Slams, and the Rio Olympics ahead of us; there is plenty to look forward to.
Still, every year the data the sport gathers and makes available to the public is way too basic. You know those end-of-match summaries with the simple counts of first serve points, second serve points, etc.</description>

      <description>This weekend we closed the chapter on the first Grand Slam of 2016. As all our news feeds overflowed with the photos of the tournament champions Novak Djokovic and first-time major winner, Angelique Kerber, in the hours that followed their victories, each snapshot was a reminder of how much can happen in just two weeks time.
Embed from Getty Images Thinking back on the events at Melbourne Park, I had the sense that the Open was a particularly surprising one for the women&amp;rsquo;s singles.</description>

It is fitting for these discussions that Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s last win of 2015 was over Roger Federer, the current World No. 3 whose achievements in the mid 2000s have often been argued to be some of the greatest in the Open Era.</description>

      <description>Last week I asked whether WAR, a comprehensive statistic of player value, has a place in tennis. Although WAR was developed for and has been primarily used in team sports to estimate a player&amp;rsquo;s contribution to team wins, its potential applications are much broader. WAR, in its most general sense, is about giving perspective to a player&amp;rsquo;s performance by comparing the outcomes of a player&amp;rsquo;s outings to a common standard: the replacement player.</description>

      <description>If, based on the title of this post, you were expecting some kind of jingoistic fantasy of tennis players armed with bazookas, you were mistaken. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that kind of war (as much as ESPN might be interested in such a gladiatorial venture); it&amp;rsquo;s about the sabermetric kind of WAR.
WAR, or wins above replacement, is a statistic used in major league baseball that attempts to measure an individual player&amp;rsquo;s value.</description>

One of the questions that most intrigued me is whether, as the title of the article suggests, any one person can &amp;ldquo;revolutionize&amp;rdquo; how we experience sports?</description>

      <description>Last week I openly admitted to a new obsession with break points, which has lead me down a path of investigations to try to understand the role of break points for winning in tennis. One product to come out of this is the concept of break point decisiveness, which I define as the percentage of matches in which the winner also won more break points than the loser. My last post showed that break point decisiveness ranges from 87 to 91% for the ATP, depending on which surface and match format (best of 3 or best of 5) is being played.</description>

      <description>As part of the work I have been doing on the Pythagorean model for wins in tennis, I have&amp;mdash;in-between MLB playoffs and the Shanghai Masters, in any case&amp;mdash;been thinking a lot about break points lately.
We all know break points are important. If a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t edge out his or her opponent&amp;rsquo;s break points won in a set, the set (and ultimately the match) will have to be decided in a tiebreak or, when a tiebreak isn&amp;rsquo;t in place, a match could go on ad infinitum as some of us thought might happen when big servers Isner and Mahut butted heads in the 2010 Wimbledon first round.</description>

      <description>Last week, based on work presented at the 2015 NESSIS, I wrote about an extension of Pythagorean Expectation to tennis, which showed that break point conversion has a strikingly similar ability to predict match wins in tennis as runs predict team wins in baseball. The Pythagorean analyses were based only on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. In this post, thanks to match statistics published by Jeff Sackmann of Tennis Abstract, I will examine the existence of a Pythagorean formula for women&amp;rsquo;s tennis.</description>

One place to start to unpack the state of analytics in tennis is by comparison to other major sports that are at the forefront of the analytics revolution. In this article I want to discuss one gap that such a comparison reveals&amp;mdash; the lack of metrics for win expectation.</description>

      <description>With the existence of Hawkeye and the IBM Slamtracker, tennis fans might be under the impression that the CPUs of tennis analysts are overflowing with high-quality stroke-by-stroke data on today&amp;rsquo;s matches. Regrettably, this is far from the truth. The data that drives the most interesting visualizations during a broadcasts, like summaries of the frequency of shots by their position on court, or the data behind the Challenge System are under the proprietary control of a few corporate giants (IBM for the Slams, SAP for the WTA), which means they are also out-of-reach of tennis researchers.</description>

Since that match, Federer has reached the finals of 5 other Grand Slams but has not won a title since his 2012 victory at Wimbledon over Andy Murray. Following that title win, he has advanced to a final at two Slams, the 2014 and 2015 Wimbledon Championships; in each case, losing to Novak Djokovic.</description>

      <description>The sabermetric revolution popularized by Moneyball forever changed the way we experience and appreciate America&amp;rsquo;s pastime. Since then, more and more sports organisations have begun to see the value of statistical analysis and opened up positions for statisticians.
Over the past decade, statistical thinking in sport has begun to spread. And we can see the impact of analytics in the way it has reshaped recruitment, game style, and game experience for many of the most popular global sports.</description>

Williams comes to Flushing Methods with a season match record of 48 wins to 2 losses—a record so close to perfection that you couldn’t blame her if she strutted onto Arthur Ashe and talked trash on a changeover or two (young Aussies, take note).</description>
