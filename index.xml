      <title>When Two First Serves are Better Than One - Part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the first and second serves can sometimes give the impression that pros have incredibly fine control of the risk of their serve, tuning the risk like the dial of a thermostat. But even for great players, risk control isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy. Sometimes the control of the second serve can get so out of whack that they are better off sticking with their first serve. This post, by guest blogger &lt;b&gt;Peter Tea&lt;/b&gt;, a masters student in statistics at Simon Fraser University, delves into when and for whom the two-first-serve strategy is a good option in tennis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The suspension of the tennis season has given tennis fans time for a number of side projects. In this post, I share the story of my side endeavour to make a central database of the results of all Grand Slams singles matches ever played. Thanks to Wikipedia and weeks of data wrangling, I can now share the first analysis on this blog that includes the entire history at the Majors: an analysis of the longest matches of all time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some of the Most Surprising Runs in Recent Grand Slam History</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With so much time these days to walk down tennis memory lane, I thought it would be fun to rank the wildest runs at the Grand Slams. In this post, I show how we can use the total gain in player ratings over an event to identify surprising individual results at the majors from the 1990s to the present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What the World Wars Might Tell Us About Returning to Top Slam Form After a Long Hiatus From Play</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no time in tennis history that compares to what tennis (or the world, for that matter) is going through right now. The World Wars were the only other time where multiple Majors were suspended for an extended period of time. In this post we look at the slam winners in the 10 years before and after World War I and II and consider what history might tell us about the difficulty of coming back from the public health war against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I described one strategy for using round, game margin, and total games to automatically rank interesting matches. After using this approach to rank the Top 30 men&amp;rsquo;s matches, in this post I do the same for the women for all Grand Slam matches from 1997 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the tours and most nations now on lockdown, many of us are feeling bereft of matches to watch. If you have been looking for great classic matches to watch and wondered where to start, I&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered! Using an &amp;lsquo;interest&amp;rsquo; score that attempts to combine match length, competitiveness and quality, I&amp;rsquo;ve ranked the 30 most interesting men&amp;rsquo;s matches from 1990 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are Top ATP Players Non-IID?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With sport at a standstill, there is ample time for sports nerds to get really wonky. In this post, I look at a question that should go to the heart of any tennis analyst: are players non-iid? I look at how we can measure non-iid effects, why we should care, and who has been the most non-iid among the Top 50 ATP players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The announcement of a 6-week suspension of the ATP Tour was just the latest in a series of disruptions of the tennis calendar owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. With no official decisions on whether players will retain their current ranking, I consider what the possible impact would be if the tours were to decide to carry current rankings forward for a prolonged period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since introducing the Research Paper Competition in 2010, the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference has become one of the biggest stages for statistical research in sport. In this post, I review the methods used by the finalists and reflect on what this could suggest about current trends in statistical analysis in the sports industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent article on Liverpool&amp;rsquo;s dominance of the English Premier League, John Burn-Murdoch created a visualization of the height and weight of EPL, NBA and NFL players. This got me interested in how current ATP players compare to the build of those other professional athletes and whether the build of top players has changed since the beginning of this century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which Set Scores Are Most Likely for all Combinations of Servers?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In her debut match after nearly 8 years out of professional play, Kim Clijsters impressed many by taking Garbine Muguruza to a second set tiebreak. Neither player was winning more than 60% of points on serve, which made me wonder how likely a tiebreak was in this case. In this post, I use a simple Monte Carlo model to examine the most likely set scores for a variety of server matchups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does greater competition load going into the second week of a Grand Slam hurt a player&#39;s win chances?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By the time of the Australian Open quarterfinals, Dominic Thiem had already played 10 hours and 23 minutes putting him in the top 20% of match time played to get to the quarters among men competing in Grand Slams in the past decade. And he only got further in the tail of total competition load as the event progressed. In this post, I look at whether the intensity of Thiem&amp;rsquo;s journey likely made his prospects for the title even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a walkover from Kohlschreiber in the R64, Stefanos Tsitsipas advanced to the third round with one fewer match played this week than any of his competitors. As Tsitsipas takes the court today for a spot in the 4th round, we look at whether skipping a round of play could have an impact on his result at the first slam of the season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ash Barty will carry the expectations of a nation when the Australian Open gets underway in a few days. But the odds suggest the 2020 AO could be 5 times a charm in Major finals for Serena Williams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are likely to look back at the end of the 2019 season as the start of a generational breakthrough in men&amp;rsquo;s tennis. With four of the most impressive 23-and-unders on tour—Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev, and Matteo Berrettini—reaching the semifinals and taking out 2 of the Big 4 on their way there, it is feeling like we are on the brink of a &amp;lsquo;Big 4&amp;rsquo; takeover by the &amp;lsquo;Next 4&amp;rsquo;. What can the early career trajectories of the Big 4 tell us about which if any of these young stars might follow their footsteps?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Short Explainer on Getting to a Laver Cup Decider</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the third instalment of the Laver Cup, Team World came the closest it has ever come to defeating the juggernaut that Team Europe continues to be. With a Day 2 score of 5-7, World, in taking the first two matches, made the contest as close as it could have been. There was some confusion about that fact by the TV commentators who seemed to think that it was still possible for the teams to get to a 13th match. Here I explain why that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case and what would have had to happen to reach a decider.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The format changes at Majors are the most prominent of a number of rule changes that are being considered to reduce the length of tennis matches in order to make the tennis &amp;lsquo;product&amp;rsquo; more attractive.

Sciences at the University of Padua investigate how removing the first serve or advantage points could impact match lengths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I looked at whether basic match stats, like aces and minutes played per point, could help describe a player&amp;rsquo;s playing style. In this post, I expand on the set of style features and delve into the clusters of playing styles they reveal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few posts on head-to-head effects. The biggest takeaway was one we probably all knew going in: Head-to-head effects may exist, but good luck finding them. With so many small sample sizes for most head-to-heads, we need a way to group &amp;lsquo;similar&amp;rsquo; players. In this post, I look at whether categorizing players by playing style might be possible using basic match stats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matchup effects are a common idea in tennis commentary. It is the thing at the heart of comments like &amp;lsquo;her game matches up well&amp;rsquo; against her opponent. One way to think of a matchup effect is as a surprising head-to-head, when results go against what the overall ability of both players would have us expect. Do such effects exist? And are they substantial enough that they matter when it comes to making better predictions about tennis results?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the close of the second month of the 2019 season, we look back at the biggest pressure performances of the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. Reilley Opelka takes top honours for having faced the most service pressure in a match in February, racking up 15.5 break point equivalents (BPEs) against John Isner in New York. Opelka also saved the most of the BPEs faces winning a whopping 92% of high-pressure service points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A model that could predict a player&amp;rsquo;s performance on serve would have a number of interesting uses like forecasting the outcome of matches or identifying surprising performances. But for any of these uses the model would need to be accurate and reliable. How should we evaluate a model&amp;rsquo;s performance? And how do we know when a model is good enough?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every player has days when everything seems to work and other days when nothing seems to go right. Saying when a player has truly over (or under) performed is tricky in tennis because there is always an opponent on the other side of the net that is also influencing the outcome of points. In this post, I look at a basic strategy to try to isolate the ability of the server and receiver, and discuss how this might be used to identify surprising performances on serve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pressure is one of those concepts in tennis that we all know exists but we struggle to calculate. I&amp;rsquo;ve made multiple attempts at quantifying scoreboard pressure and have yet to come around to one that is both statistically useful and easy to interpret. But some recent experimenting has uncovered what I think could be as close to a &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; statistic for pressure as I am likely to find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tsitsipas&amp;rsquo;s journey at the 2019 AO is the biggest of multiple success stories for a young crop of talents on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour, stories that have already made this year one of the most unique in AO history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The intermittent rain and late nights at the 2018 French Open have resulted in multiple interrupted matches, including the bottom half of the men&amp;rsquo;s quarterfinals. We often have the impression that reversals and big swings are more likely with an interrupted match. Does the data back up this impression of the impact of suspended play?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In reaching the quarterfinal at the 2018 French Open, Alexander Zverev not only has earned the best Grand Slam result of his career, he also joins a short list of 4 men in the Open Era who have played 3 or more five-set matches on their way to the Roland Garros quarterfinals. Is Zverev&amp;rsquo;s gruelling journey to the second week most likely to hurt or help his chances for the title?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, as part of the final R16 lineup at the French Open, Serena Williams will have the opportunity to bring her near-perfect record over Maria Sharapova to a staggering 20 to 2. Many have wondered how much Williams&amp;rsquo; dominance over the &amp;lsquo;Unstoppable&amp;rsquo; author is fuelled by more than pure ability. In this post, we attempt to understand the &lt;i&gt;inexplicable&lt;/i&gt; part of their head-to-head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Elo rating system is one of the most popular tools for rating player and team performance. In this post, I show how we can take the Elo system beyond match wins and use it to rate players on the two most fundamental skills in the sport: serving and returning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a metric for match excitement would be a useful tool for separating humdrum matches from thrillers. In this post, I have a look at two indices for measuring match excitement and discuss what&amp;rsquo;s to like and dislike about each.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2017 MLB World Series gave baseball fans a thrill-ride for the post-season. It also gives us an idea of how to size up the excitement of a sporting event. In this post, we look at an &amp;lsquo;excitement&amp;rsquo; statistic for tennis and use it to rank the excitement of men&amp;rsquo;s matches at the 2017 US Open.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the major tennis storylines of 2017 has been the opening up of the field on the WTA tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a number of former dominant players, like Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka, out of the game and others, like Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova, still early in their return, 2017 has presented a massive opportunity to the tour&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;rising stars. Out of 13 Premier and Grand Slam events completed this season, 10 different women have taken the title win. This has given tennis fans many possible picks for who will emerge as the next major threat on the WTA tour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It only took a few days of main draw play for the 2017 French Open to give fodder to debates on the unpredictability of this year&amp;rsquo;s women&amp;rsquo;s tour. After two rounds, just 9 of the 32 seeds survived to the round of 32, 23 fewer than expected. Those numbers caused &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/06/tennis-channel-roland-garros-2017-wta-player-draft-update-french-open/66477/&#34;&gt;tennis.com&lt;/a&gt; to conclude that the women&amp;rsquo;s draw was &amp;ldquo;decimated&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I took a look at the clay-court serve performance of four of the ATP players most in contention for the 2017 Roland Garros title— Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2017/05/21/Top-Contenders-French-Open/&#34;&gt;That analysis&lt;/a&gt; showed that Rafael Nadal has so far separated himself on serve by 5 to 15 percentage points on average. An impressive stat next to anyone but especially when compared to the players who are some of his toughest rivals for another Major win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that the dust has settled at the Rome Masters, the tennis world is turning its focus to the French Open, where main draw play is nearly upon us. With Roger Federer skipping Roland Garros when not injured for the first time since he first played the event in 1999, the four names that will be most in the discussion for the win are Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. In this post, we look at the clay court season so far and what it tells us about the form for each of these top contenders going into the second Major of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But with a Round of 16 loss this week to Borna Coric at the Mutua Madrid Open, Murray has crashed out earlier than expected for his third clay court event of the season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the coin toss or the bounce off a clipped net, some events in a tennis match are outside of a player&amp;rsquo;s control. And the sport accepts that. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept it when it comes to line calls, especially when there is technology that can prevent line call errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are Net Points Murray&#39;s Kryptonite?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite starting the 2017 season as World No. 1 for the first time in his career, Andy Murray has had a lackluster go of it so far. After Murray&amp;rsquo;s Round of 16 loss at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, his match record was 13 and 4. Now, in terms of wins and losses alone, that puts him on par with his performances thru the end of April in 2016 and 2014, but far behind his record in 2015 when he had bagged 23 wins and just 5 losses by this point in the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The tennis world is abuzz with speculation over the future of Serena Williams. In an already extraordinary week in which the 23 Grand Slam title-owning champion was projected to reclaim the World No. 1 without having played an event since this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open, Williams, in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/04/19/serena-williams-reveals-20-weeks-pregnant/&#34;&gt;cheeky snapchat post&lt;/a&gt;, announced that she was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With less than 2 weeks until Maria Sharapova makes her return, there is a growing stir of speculation over her comeback. Having already been granted controversial wild cards and 3 Premier events, including the upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/03/caroline-wozniacki-venus-williams-maria-sharapova-wildcard-stuttgart/64746/&#34;&gt;Stuttgart Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, Sharapova—after 15 months out of the game—will return to tennis with a unique opportunity to avoid the usual entry prohibitions of unranked players. Her first match will be in the middle of the first round of Stuttgart on April 26th where she will have a chance to take 470 ranking points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the first quarter of the 2017 season, Roger Federer has his 18th Grand Slam title and a 19-1 win record overall. Such an impressive start naturally leads us to ask: Where should we rank Federer&amp;rsquo;s 2017 start against the other seasons of his career? How does it compare to the best season starts in tennis history?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With modern tracking data, it is possible to get an almost continuous representation of the locations of both the ball and players during a tennis match. The richness of these data is a huge boon for tennis research but it comes with some challenges too. A lot of my time these days is spent thinking about how best to visualise this information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If tennis fans thought Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open win over Rafael Nadal was a fluke in an otherwise lopsided head-to-head, Federer&amp;rsquo;s devastating victory over Nadal this week at the Indian Wells Masters was a clear message that the AO won&amp;rsquo;t be a one-off for his 2017 season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the sports analytics world descended on Boston for the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC). Co-founded by Daryl Morey, general manager for the Houston Rockets—a team that, during his tenure, has shaped its identity around its relentless and often innovative use of stats—SSAC has become one of the most popular events for academics and hobbyists to share cutting edge research in sports data science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With all of the tiers that exist on the professional tennis circuit, from 10K events up to the Majors, I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered how tournament tiers should be factored into Elo predictions and whether some events should be excluded entirely. The standard Elo gives players a bigger boost (10% exactly) for wins at Majors but treats wins against similar opponents at any other event the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With only two of the top 8 seeds reaching the quarterfinals at the first Grand Slam of the year, the 2017 Australian Open was a trainwreck for most prediction models. Even the Elo forecasting system, one of the most accurate open prediction approaches in tennis, couldn&amp;rsquo;t have anticipated the unusual conditions of this year&amp;rsquo;s Major down under.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, you are spending the day after the final match of the 2017 Australian Open looking for ways to relive the startling 35th meeting of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. At the start of the tournament, the chances that Federer would win the title were just 3%; Nadal was an even greater underdog with just 1.5%. Seeing either of them in the final match at Rod Laver Arena wasn&amp;rsquo;t suppose to happen. Yet here we are the day after both men defied the odds and produced what is likely to be one of the most storied moments in tennis history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Even with the men&amp;rsquo;s final still to come, we can already say that the 2017 Australian Open brought more surprises than anyone expected. As much as we will be focused on the surprise of another Williams sister final and the 35th meeting of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overlook the less familiar names that impressed us at the first Slam of the season.
Since it is sometimes hard to look back at two weeks of matchplay and pick out the performances that surprised us most, I was thinking how you might try to put a number to &amp;ldquo;improvement&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the prospect of a Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer final at this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open, many are probably wondering if we are in store for the relatively speedy match when they last played here in 2014 or an epic more like their four-hour plus semifinal at the 2012 AO. There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much that is predictable about this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open. One had to be clairvoyant to have picked a Nadal-Federer final (if that turns out to be what we get) let alone how long such a meeting could last.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the curious things about tennis is that every seeded player&amp;rsquo;s path to the title is different. When the champions are hoisting a tournament trophy over their heads, we largely ignore the role that luck might have played in their victory. But should it be ignored? And how much of a role does luck play anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The stats from Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group showed that men at the Australian Open travel 2 to 3 miles per match and the big servers of the game tend to travel the least of all players.
But what about the women&amp;rsquo;s tour? What are the typical distances for them and who are the biggest movers?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a tennis match broadcast you will sometimes see a stat on the distances run by players. But we rarely get a look at the distances run over all matches in a tournament or a season, numbers that could tell us what kinds of distances are typical at the elite level and what are extreme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s games differ the most is the serve. While previous posts on this site have shown that the speeds of men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s groundstrokes are actually &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2016/11/26/AOLeaderboard-Forehand-Speed/&#34;&gt;fairly comparable&lt;/a&gt;, the men separate themselves by far on serve. On hard court, the average first serve for men is 115 mph and the average first serve for women is 99 mph.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we think of the best ralliers in the game, we are thinking of the players who not only have a penchant for extended points but also win those points. While tournaments will sometimes tell us about typical rally lengths, we don&amp;rsquo;t usually know how a player&amp;rsquo;s chances of winning a point vary with rally length. In this post, I look into this question using Australian Open statistics provided by the Game Insight Group of Tennis Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Rally lengths are a useful measure for differentiating styles of play. Players who tend to keep points to a few shots would be expected to be dominant on serve and more willing to go to net. Players who tend to grind out extended rallies would tend to be the baseliners whose best weapons are their groundstrokes and endurance.
Some analysts have characterised the professional game as first strike tennis, because the majority of points are 4 shots or fewer (counting the serve).</description>

      <description>In my last post I discussed the idea of return pressure and suggested that it could be measured by looking at the amount of time a receiver gives the server to prepare for their second shot. Players who exert more pressure with their return of serve are expected to get a quicker jump on the ball and make a more powerful shot inside the baseline.
In this post I want to focus on one part of that equation, the quick jump, by looking at reaction times on the serve return.</description>

      <description>The tennis world is gearing up for the ATP World Tour Finals, where 8 of the best male players will vie for the final major title of 2016. One of the things that could be decisive in who advances to the semifinals is the pressure of the return. Here, when I refer to return pressure, I am thinking of the kind of player who jumps on the serve and makes an attacking shot that gives the server little time to react.</description>

      <description>The Masters in Bercy continues concerns over Novak Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s form going into the Tour Finals. With the loss to Marin Cilic in Paris and Andy Murray one win away from taking the World No. 1 spot, the 2016 season has raised many questions about Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s performance. While we see the indicators of a slump from his win record, we can&amp;rsquo;t know whether and how his game has actually changed— has he lost effectiveness on serve?</description>

      <description>This week continues the rollout of a collection of new statistics describing the quality of shots in tennis. Last week began with a look at groundstroke speeds, focusing on the backhand. This week we turn to the accuracy of groundstrokes and look specifically at how frequently shots land close to the line.
Whether a ball lands close to a line is obviously a subjective call. In the summaries that follow, I will use 3 ball lengths (approximately 21 cm) as &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe that it is only a few months before the start of the 2017 ATP and WTA seasons. Preparations for the 2017 AO in Melbourne are already in high gear. There will be a lot of developments you can expect to see come January, including some new stats using Hawk-Eye ball and player tracking data. These stats were developed by Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group— a team of scientists TA has brought together to advance the use of analytics in tennis. As a data scientist for the GIG, I wanted to preview these developments and some of the things we are learning from tracking data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few posts, I have been applying a new metric &lt;em&gt;clutch averages&lt;/em&gt; to the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s singles matches at the 2016 U.S. Open. The purpose of these averages is to focus on how players tend to perform on the most important points in a match. In this way, these stats can help us to find out which players win the majority of the most important points? And which players are most and least affected by the scoreline?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This week I do the same review for the men. As before, the clutch performance represented here is the summary of the most important points won on serve (Figure 1) and return (Figure 2). These summaries include big points like break points, of course, but also factors in other important points &amp;ndash; like tiebreak points or 30-all situations late in a set. In each case, the score situation is weighed by its relative importance, which is its expected influence on a win or loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The 2016 U.S. Open might now be a faint memory of the news cycle but there are still plenty of stories about player performance that were never told. This week, I have been digging into the point-by-point data from this year&amp;rsquo;s matches at Flushing to find out how players handled the biggest moments of the tournament.
I have talked before about how we can use a point&amp;rsquo;s importance to identify who are the most clutch performers in the sport.</description>

      <description>The final day of the 2016 U.S. Open brought us the 26th meeting of Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka. Djokovic has built up such a win record in recent years that, even at the final stage of a Grand Slam against as formidable an opponent as World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka, he was still the favorite by far. FiveThirtyEight predictions gave the World No. 1 an 88% chance of winning his 13th Major title.</description>

Kerber had already secured the World No. 1 rank in getting to the finals, after Williams defeat to Pliskova in the semifinal. Pliskova was on a terrifying run, taking out both Williams sisters to get her spot in the final.</description>

The first match of the day pitted a fresh Novak Djokovic against showman and crowd favorite Gael Monfils. The day was be closed out by the matchup of Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka. Both matches were hard-fought and delivered a packed highlight reel.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shocks keep coming at the U.S. Open. After Kei Nishikori&amp;rsquo;s surprising upset of Andy Murray in the quarterfinals of Day 10, Day 11 brought us another massive upset. Today it was Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; turn to exit the tournament, as Karolina Pliskova denied her a 23rd major title. After the loss to Roberta Vinci at the 2015 U.S. Open, this makes for back-to-back disappointments for Williams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two of the favorites for the title—Serena Williams and Andy Murray—were on center stage. Serena Williams was tested by a determined Simona Halep but would eventually make it through. Andy Murray, on the other hand, would fall in 5 to Japanese No 1. Kei Nishikori. Here are visual summaries of how those and the two other quarterfinal matches of the day were decided.</description>

The expectations for each match are based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-us-open-tennis-predictions/mens/&#34;&gt;player Elo ratings&lt;/a&gt;. These ratings tells us how capable a player should be of winning a match against their drawn opponent if both players are playing to their expected ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you are like me you have spent a good part of the weekend digesting the draw and making predictions about which matches could be the most interesting to come out of Flushing Meadows. In this post, I want to highlight a few of the matches that stood out to me. In doing so, I also want to introduce a new way of looking at recent form with something I call &lt;strong&gt;clutch averaging&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As with the men&amp;rsquo;s preview, I have selected among matches of players who have some match history and have reported. For each match, clutch summary statistics of the players&amp;rsquo; last meeting and most recent result are shown.</description>

      <title>Charting Shots Over Expectations</title>

      <description>In statistics, an expectation is a way to quantify what is typical or likely. And, when we compare what actually happened against what was expected, we have a way to judge how surprised or unimpressed we should be.
Despite their usefulness, you are as likely to see a probabilistic expectation in tennis as you are a floral pattern at Wimbledon. Mainstream tennis stats only report what happened, not what was likely to happen.</description>

      <description>One of the many things I miss after the dissolution of Bill Simmons&amp;rsquo; sports blog Grantland is Kirk Goldsberry&amp;rsquo;s NBA shot charts. The classic version of the Goldsberry shot chart is a plot of hexagonal bins showing the locations and frequency of where a player takes shots overlaid onto a representation of the basketball court. Combined with heavy annotation and a lot of style, the charts are both effective at communicating shot tendencies and a pure pleasure to read (an example for Steph Curry is shown to the right).</description>

      <description>While most of the sports world has had been focused on the start of the summer Olympics this week, a small group of diehard sports statisticians were attending the Joint Statistical Meetings in Chicago and catching up with recent advances in sports analytics. During my time there, I was fortunate to participate in a panel entitled &amp;ldquo;Harnessing the Extraordinary Power of Statistics in Sports&amp;rdquo;. The panel was organized by Michael Lopez, of Skidmore College and twitter fame @StatsByLopez, and chaired by Michael Schuckers at St.</description>

      <description>July has been a stellar month for British player Johanna Konta. After defeating one of her idols, Venus Williams, to win a Premier title at Stanford, Konta will play today for a spot in the semifinal of the Rogers Cup.
Embed from Getty Images This month, Konta just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to lose. When players hit a streak like Konta has, it can sometime seem like winning becomes inevitable, as if with each win added to their record the next win becomes even more likely.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2016 Wimbledon Championships brought us a number of stories and memorable matches. But, with the third round exit of Novak Djokovic, we &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; get to see a semifinal between Djokovic and Federer. We will have to wait a few more weeks for the arrival of the US Open for the next opportunity to see if Federer can still test Djokovic on a slam stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a sad day for Federer fans. After a glorious comeback from two sets down in the quarterfinals, Federer&amp;rsquo;s bid for an eighth Wimbledon title was cut short by big-serving Milos Raonic on Friday.
Like most close matches, the margins separating Federer and Raonic were tiny. With 70% of points won on serve and 29% of points won on return, Federer was just one percentage point behind the Canadian star on both skills.</description>

      <description>One of the matches we can look forward to—rain or shine—on Day 6 of the Wimbledon Championships is World No. 2 Andy Murray against Aussie John Millman. Murray&amp;rsquo;s run at Wimbledon is an especially interesting one because it is the first Grand Slam since Murray&amp;rsquo;s reunion with legend coach Ivan Lendl. The on-again off-again partnership provides an interesting natural experiment of the &amp;ldquo;coach effect&amp;rdquo; and gives us one more reason to look back at one of my favorite tennis memes of all time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Britain&amp;rsquo;s decision to Brexit will inevitably make for an unusual backdrop at the 2016 Wimbledon, which gets underway this weekend. But with a packed draw and stadium roofs to combat uncooperative weather, we can still expect the next two weeks to bring us some unforgettable matches and headline worthy moments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Choking is one of the most fascinating phenomena in sport. 2016 provided us with a spectacular example of a choke when Jordan Spieth made a quadruple-bogey on hole 12 of the Augusta Masters, setting into motion the loss of a near-certain win on the final day on those hallowed links.
Although we may not ever see a meltdown of that magnitude again for years to come, it still serves as a reminder of the role of pressure in competition.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, when the sun finally shone down on Philippe Chatrier, we witnessed two very different but equally fascinating storylines emerge. On the women&amp;rsquo;s side, twenty-two year old Garbiñe Muguruza, a rising star with only one previous appearance in a Grand Slam final, thwarted Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; third bid at her twenty-second title to her first major win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zebra prints and back-to-back matches haven&amp;rsquo;t been the only strange things to appear at this year&amp;rsquo;s French Open. The washout that has been a catastrophe for the 2016 Roland Garros schedule has created a myriad of unusual pressures and demands for the players (and a few of them have been vocal about their dislike of the situation). As a consequence of all this, player adaptability and grit have taken higher places in the list of skills needed to advance to the next round than would be the case in drier conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With only 2 2016 clay court titles among the top 4 seeds on the women&amp;rsquo;s side and Serena Williams without a major title since last year&amp;rsquo;s Wimbledon, it&amp;rsquo;s looking like anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess over which WTA player will walk away with the Roland Garros title in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After Novak Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s surprising early exit last month at the Monte Carlo Masters tournament, this week it was Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s turn. His first clay court event since Monte Carlo was brought to a decisive halt when he lost to Dominic Thiem in the third round at the Rome Masters.
Now any player can have an off day, especially when coming back from injury. But when it happens to the best players in the game, it&amp;rsquo;s often the source of alarm.</description>

      <description>After two close semifinals, World No. 2 Andy Murray is set to defend his Madrid Masters title against top seed Novak Djokovic. The fact that the two go into the match at the top of the ATP rankings leaderboard suggests that we are in store for a quality match, with Djokovic being the perennial favorite.
But what exactly does the difference of one position in ranking really tell us about the expected quality of play?</description>

But the tables quickly turned and after taking the second sets in 6-2 and 6-3, Thiem ultimately prevailed, securing a spot in the final against Philipp Kohlschreiber.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The break-heavy clay court season continued in the men&amp;rsquo;s semifinal match where World No. 5 Rafael Nadal faced-off against 31st-ranked Fabio Fognini. There were a total of 8 breaks in the match, 4 in each set. There were also two of the most frustrating of break phenomena, the back-to-back break. The first came in the fifth game of the first set, when Fognini broke Nadal&amp;rsquo;s serve and put himself on the scoreboard for the first time.</description>

      <description>With the second round exit of Novak Djokovic and the quarterfinal loss of Roger Federer, the finals of the 2016 Monte Carlo Masters brought us a pairing we might not have expected on Day 1, but a thrilling one nonetheless. The first two sets between Rafael Nadal and Gael Monfils on Sunday were as tightly contested as the fans that withstood a rainy morning in Monaco could have hoped for. Each player exchanged a 7-5 win, battling through multiple long rallies and over two hours of matchplay to reach the third deciding set.</description>

      <description>Raymond Moore&amp;rsquo;s display of sexism at this year&amp;rsquo;s BNP Paribas Open put a more intense spotlight on gender equality in tennis than any of us were expecting. The processing of his statements and resignation as tournament director prompted some insightful perspective-taking by former and current players. At the same time, it also encouraged more of the same old pitting of the WTA and ATP tours against each other.
With this backdrop in mind, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but cringe when I read myth 6 of Klaasseen and Magnus: &amp;lsquo;the probability that the service is in is the same in men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s singles&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The 5th myth in Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s examination of some of the most common beliefs in tennis puts point importance at center stage once again. With myth 5, K&amp;amp;M ask if there is any truth to the idea that all points in tennis are equally important.
Of all of the 22 beliefs that K&amp;amp;M consider in Analyzing Wimbledon this is the one that probably has the least traction in the tennis community.</description>

The 10th anniversary of the two-day nerd fest attracted 3,900 attendees and some of the heaviest hitters in sports stats, including Bill James, Nate Silver, and Mike Zarren.
One of the traditional features of Sloan is the research competition. In true sporting fashion, this is a multi-stage, single-elimination tournament that pits the top research innovations in sports analytics against each other.</description>

      <description>The next myth in our look back at Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s takedown of 22 tennis myths is Myth 3. This myth concerns the importance of points and whether each point is equally important to the server and returner.
Myth 3: &amp;ldquo;Every point (game, set) is equally important to both players&amp;rdquo; In Analyzing Wimbledon Klaassen and Magnus make the logically argument that a point is always equally important to the server and receiver.</description>

      <description>The second myth addressed in Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s instant classic of tennis analysis, Analyzing Wimbledon, is the myth of serving first in a match.
Myth 2: &amp;ldquo;Is there an advantage to serve first in a set?&amp;rdquo; The coin toss is one of those pre-match rituals that many of us fast-forward through. If you can recall any occasion when you have stopped to watch the coin toss, there is a very good chance that the player who won the toss opted to serve.</description>

      <description>Books on tennis statistics are as rare as black swans. So I take notice whenever one appears.
One of the most recent of these scarce creatures is Franc Klaassen and Jan Magnus&amp;rsquo;s Analyzing Wimbledon. Despite having primary appointments in economic departments, Klaassen and Magnus have produced some of the most scholarly mathematical papers on tennis. Analyzing Wimbledon is a compilation of the findings that have come out of their long partnership, synthesized into a list of 22 myths of tennis.</description>

Still, every year the data the sport gathers and makes available to the public is way too basic. You know those end-of-match summaries with the simple counts of first serve points, second serve points, etc.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend we closed the chapter on the first Grand Slam of 2016. As all our  news feeds overflowed with the photos of the tournament champions Novak Djokovic and first-time major winner, Angelique Kerber, in the hours that followed their victories, each snapshot was a reminder of how much can happen in just two weeks time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as some people are unusually good at finding the perfect gift to put under the Christmas tree, some tennis players are unusually good at pulling out a win when it matters most. This is the quintessential characteristic of the &amp;ldquo;clutch player&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Another Take on the Best Season Debate</title>

      <description>After solidifying a career best season with the win of the ATP Tour Finals, definitive World No. 1 Novak Djokovic set the tennis world chattering about where his 2015 season stood in the history of best tennis seasons. It is fitting for these discussions that Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s last win of 2015 was over Roger Federer, the current World No. 3 whose achievements in the mid 2000s have often been argued to be some of the greatest in the Open Era.</description>

      <description>Last week I asked whether WAR, a comprehensive statistic of player value, has a place in tennis. Although WAR was developed for and has been primarily used in team sports to estimate a player&amp;rsquo;s contribution to team wins, its potential applications are much broader. WAR, in its most general sense, is about giving perspective to a player&amp;rsquo;s performance by comparing the outcomes of a player&amp;rsquo;s outings to a common standard: the replacement player.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If, based on the title of this post, you were expecting some kind of jingoistic fantasy of tennis players armed with bazookas, you were mistaken. This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that kind of war (as much as &lt;em&gt;ESPN&lt;/em&gt; might be interested in such a gladiatorial venture); it&amp;rsquo;s about the sabermetric kind of WAR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, FiveThirtyEight writer Oliver Roeder published an article entitled &amp;ldquo;Can An Astrophysicist Change The Way We Watch Sports?&amp;quot; The piece documents the efforts of Matt Ginsberg (the astrophysicist in question) to develop a system for real-time predictions of shot-making for the NBA and, at the same time, raises a number of broad questions about the future of advanced analytics in sports and sports broadcasting. One of the questions that most intrigued me is whether, as the title of the article suggests, any one person can &amp;ldquo;revolutionize&amp;rdquo; how we experience sports?</description>

      <title>Break Points are More Decisive for WTA</title>

      <description>Last week I openly admitted to a new obsession with break points, which has lead me down a path of investigations to try to understand the role of break points for winning in tennis. One product to come out of this is the concept of break point decisiveness, which I define as the percentage of matches in which the winner also won more break points than the loser. My last post showed that break point decisiveness ranges from 87 to 91% for the ATP, depending on which surface and match format (best of 3 or best of 5) is being played.</description>

      <description>As part of the work I have been doing on the Pythagorean model for wins in tennis, I have—in-between MLB playoffs and the Shanghai Masters, in any case—been thinking a lot about break points lately.
We all know break points are important. If a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t edge out his or her opponent&amp;rsquo;s break points won in a set, the set (and ultimately the match) will have to be decided in a tiebreak or, when a tiebreak isn&amp;rsquo;t in place, a match could go on ad infinitum as some of us thought might happen when big servers Isner and Mahut butted heads in the 2010 Wimbledon first round.</description>

      <description>Last week, based on work presented at the 2015 NESSIS, I wrote about an extension of Pythagorean Expectation to tennis, which showed that break point conversion has a strikingly similar ability to predict match wins in tennis as runs predict team wins in baseball. The Pythagorean analyses were based only on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. In this post, thanks to match statistics published by Jeff Sackmann of Tennis Abstract, I will examine the existence of a Pythagorean formula for women&amp;rsquo;s tennis.</description>

      <description>In the short life of this blog, I have, on several occasions, complained about the lack of analytics in tennis. But what evidence is there to back up this view? One place to start to unpack the state of analytics in tennis is by comparison to other major sports that are at the forefront of the analytics revolution. In this article I want to discuss one gap that such a comparison reveals— the lack of metrics for win expectation.</description>

      <description>With the existence of Hawkeye and the IBM Slamtracker, tennis fans might be under the impression that the CPUs of tennis analysts are overflowing with high-quality stroke-by-stroke data on today&amp;rsquo;s matches. Regrettably, this is far from the truth. The data that drives the most interesting visualizations during a broadcasts, like summaries of the frequency of shots by their position on court, or the data behind the Challenge System are under the proprietary control of a few corporate giants (IBM for the Slams, SAP for the WTA), which means they are also out-of-reach of tennis researchers.</description>

      <description>Today, Roger Federer will make his first appearance at a US Open final since 2009, where he lost to Juan Martin Del Potro. Since that match, Federer has reached the finals of 5 other Grand Slams but has not won a title since his 2012 victory at Wimbledon over Andy Murray. Following that title win, he has advanced to a final at two Slams, the 2014 and 2015 Wimbledon Championships; in each case, losing to Novak Djokovic.</description>

      <description>Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; loss to unseeded Roberta Vinci at the 2015 US Open semifinal put a shocking end to Williams&amp;rsquo; run for a Calendar Slam. When Vinci stepped onto Ashe yesterday, the task before her must have seemed unthinkable. She had never won a set against Williams in their 4 previous meetings, and all of their prior matches were before the semifinal round, when Williams&amp;rsquo; is known not to play at her highest level.</description>

      <description>At the 2015 US Open, IBM is continuing its long partnership with the USTA to bring tennis fans &amp;ldquo;more than the score&amp;quot;. One of the main ways that Big Blue is going beyond the score is with their Keys to the Match&amp;ndash;basically, a dashboard with performance targets for a given head-to-head.
If you are like me and have ever perused the Keys on a changeover over player bathroom break, you might have wondered exactly what insights they contain.</description>

      <description>When Serena Williams turns 34 in a few weeks, she will very likely have added a 22nd Major title and Calendar Slam to her CV&amp;ndash;securing her reign as the most decorated thirty-and-over in the sport. A decade ago, few would have believed that a tennis player in her mid-thirties would be at the peak of her game. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that Williams&amp;rsquo; achievements and resurgence at this stage in her career are exceptional.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heat was the main topic of discussion on Day 4 of the US Open. The brutal effects of sweltering temperatures and stifling humidity took centerstage during the afternoon play when American Jack Sock collapsed in the third set of his match against Ruben Bemelmans. Sock&amp;ndash;who looked unconscious as the medical team on site rushed to his aid&amp;ndash;was forced to retire and was subsequently diagnosed with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/09/03/american-tennis-player-jack-sock-collapses-on-court-at-u-s-open/&#34;&gt;heat illness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Day 4 of the 2015 US Open and the tournament has already brought a lot of surprises. While we all might have expected Nick Kyrgios to exit with flare in the first round, few of us would have anticipated that the first round would say farewell to so many of the seeds. The ladies&amp;rsquo; draw feels especially bare after 11 of 32 seeds (34%) did not advance to the second round&amp;ndash;Stephens (29), Pavlyuchenkova (31), Pliskova (8), Kuznetsova (30), Suarez Navarro (10), Jankovic (21), Ivanovic (7), Safarova (6), Begu (28), Bacsinszky (14), Cornet (27).</description>

      <description>The sabermetric revolution popularized by Moneyball forever changed the way we experience and appreciate America&amp;rsquo;s pastime. Since then, more and more sports organisations have begun to see the value of statistical analysis and opened up positions for statisticians.
Over the past decade, statistical thinking in sport has begun to spread. And we can see the impact of analytics in the way it has reshaped recruitment, game style, and game experience for many of the most popular global sports.</description>

      <title>Serena Williams’ Only Obstacle to a Calendar Slam is Herself</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a 21-minute opening match at the US Open that ended with her opponent&amp;rsquo;s retirement, Serena Williams is now 6 victories from her first Calendar Slam and 22nd career major title, tying her with Steffi Graf for the woman with the most Slam titles in the Open Era. Williams comes to Flushing Methods with a season match record of 48 wins to 2 losses—a record so close to perfection that you couldn’t blame her if she strutted onto Arthur Ashe and talked trash on a changeover or two (young Aussies, take note). But don’t expect Williams to rock swag until the Open trophy is sitting securely in her hands. As much as the wins keep coming, the queen of the court’s confidence has been in a perplexing slump.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This made me wonder: was this one of the most surprising runs ever in tennis?To try to answer this question, I look at the likelihood of players&amp;rsquo; runs under Elo. The likelihood is simply the probabilities of multiple events multiplied together.</description>
