      <title>Is an Early Walkover an Advantage in a Slam?</title>
      <link>https://skoval.github.io/2020/01/24/slam-walkover-advantage/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a walkover from Kohlschreiber in the R64, Stefanos Tsitsipas advanced to the third round with one fewer match played this week than any of his competitors. As Tsitsipas takes the court today for a spot in the 4th round, we look at whether skipping a round of play could have an impact on his result at the first slam of the season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The draw for the 2020 Australian Open is out! What are the chances among the Big 3 for the first Grand Slam of the year? And is anyone else a strong prospect this year?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ash Barty will carry the expectations of a nation when the Australian Open gets underway in a few days. But the odds suggest the 2020 AO could be 5 times a charm in Major finals for Serena Williams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I looked the the players who faced the most pressure at the Grand Slams in 2019. In this post, I ask the next obvious question. Who performed the best under high pressure?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are likely to look back at the end of the 2019 season as the start of a generational breakthrough in men&amp;rsquo;s tennis. With four of the most impressive 23-and-unders on tour—Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev, and Matteo Berrettini—reaching the semifinals and taking out 2 of the Big 4 on their way there, it is feeling like we are on the brink of a &amp;lsquo;Big 4&amp;rsquo; takeover by the &amp;lsquo;Next 4&amp;rsquo;. What can the early career trajectories of the Big 4 tell us about which if any of these young stars might follow their footsteps?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Short Explainer on Getting to a Laver Cup Decider</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the third instalment of the Laver Cup, Team World came the closest it has ever come to defeating the juggernaut that Team Europe continues to be. With a Day 2 score of 5-7, World, in taking the first two matches, made the contest as close as it could have been. There was some confusion about that fact by the TV commentators who seemed to think that it was still possible for the teams to get to a 13th match. Here I explain why that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case and what would have had to happen to reach a decider.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The performances of Daniil Medvedev and Matteo Berrettini at the 2019 US Open showed that the future of men&amp;rsquo;s tennis is bright. In this post, I look at the point-by-point pressure each of these young stars had to confront and analyze how well they responded to it in each round of their US Open journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The format changes at Majors are the most prominent of a number of rule changes that are being considered to reduce the length of tennis matches in order to make the tennis &amp;lsquo;product&amp;rsquo; more attractive. In this guest post, Francesco Lisi and Matteo Grigoletto of the Department of Statistical
Sciences at the University of Padua investigate how removing the first serve or advantage points could impact match lengths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A constant conundrum for tennis fans is deciding which match to watch at any particular time. In this post, I look at how we can quanitfy the &amp;lsquo;must-seeness&amp;rsquo; of a match based on it&amp;rsquo;s overall quality and competitiveness using player ratings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the US Open hard court swing just around the corner, Ash Barty heads into the last leg of the season with the highest rating in women&amp;rsquo;s singles and doubles. Such simultaneous dominance in singles and doubles has, in the past decade, only been matched by Serena Williams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I looked at whether basic match stats, like aces and minutes played per point, could help describe a player&amp;rsquo;s playing style.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few posts on head-to-head effects. The biggest takeaway was one we probably all knew going in: Head-to-head effects may exist, but good luck finding them. With so many small sample sizes for most head-to-heads, we need a way to group &amp;lsquo;similar&amp;rsquo; players. In this post, I look at whether categorizing players by playing style might be possible using basic match stats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matchup effects are a common idea in tennis commentary. It is the thing at the heart of comments like &amp;lsquo;her game matches up well&amp;rsquo; against her opponent. One way to think of a matchup effect is as a surprising head-to-head, when results go against what the overall ability of both players would have us expect. Do such effects exist? And are they substantial enough that they matter when it comes to making better predictions about tennis results?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the close of the second month of the 2019 season, we look back at the biggest pressure performances of the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. Reilley Opelka takes top honours for having faced the most service pressure in a match in February, racking up 15.5 break point equivalents (BPEs) against John Isner in New York. Opelka also saved the most of the BPEs faces winning a whopping 92% of high-pressure service points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A model that could predict a player&amp;rsquo;s performance on serve would have a number of interesting uses like forecasting the outcome of matches or identifying surprising performances. But for any of these uses the model would need to be accurate and reliable. How should we evaluate a model&amp;rsquo;s performance? And how do we know when a model is good enough?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every player has days when everything seems to work and other days when nothing seems to go right. Saying when a player has truly over (or under) performed is tricky in tennis because there is always an opponent on the other side of the net that is also influencing the outcome of points. In this post, I look at a basic strategy to try to isolate the ability of the server and receiver, and discuss how this might be used to identify surprising performances on serve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pressure is one of those concepts in tennis that we all know exists but we struggle to calculate. I&amp;rsquo;ve made multiple attempts at quantifying scoreboard pressure and have yet to come around to one that is both statistically useful and easy to interpret. But some recent experimenting has uncovered what I think could be as close to a &amp;lsquo;best&amp;rsquo; statistic for pressure as I am likely to find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his win over Roger Federer, 20 year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas not only earned the biggest upset of the 2019 Australian Open so far, he caused many to wonder whether tennis was seeing the start of a new era. Tsitsipas&amp;rsquo;s journey at the 2019 AO is the biggest of multiple success stories for a young crop of talents on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour, stories that have already made this year one of the most unique in AO history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a super tiebreak in the deciding set of singles matches was one of a number of changes at the 2019 Australian Open. After two rounds, 3 men&amp;rsquo;s and 2 women&amp;rsquo;s matches have already put that rule to the test. What do the outcomes of those matches tell us about the possible impact of the new format?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the first round of the Australian Open, I take a look at some of the likely winners on the men&amp;rsquo;s side. The forecast bodes well for the Big 3, with Novak Djokovic leading the race toward the first slam title of the 2019 season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After introducing &lt;em&gt;Pressure Ratings&lt;/em&gt; for matches, this post looks at how a similar approach can be used to develop a &lt;em&gt;Set Competitiveness&lt;/em&gt; rating for players. The &lt;em&gt;Set Competitiveness&lt;/em&gt; measures the pressure of a player&amp;rsquo;s sets in a way that allows direct ranking against the pressure typically faced by other players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Novak Djokovic will regain the World No. 1 ranking, climbing from outside the top 20 at the start of the year. Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s comeback has been the major story this week. In this post, I look at his rise in terms of his match-by-match Elo rating and put it in context of his best season performances in 2011 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prize money has been the primary yardstick for measuring gender inequality in professional tennis. Most in-depth studies of prize money differences have focused on earnings of top players or prize money commitments by tournament.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are into the quarterfinals at the 2018 US Open. No matter what happens in the final days of the event, we already know that one of the major storylines of this year will be Alexander Zverev&amp;rsquo;s failure to get to the second week. Zverev&amp;rsquo;s third round loss to Philipp Kohlschreiber makes the 14th loss at a slam, 13 of which have been before the quarterfinals. With this slam record, what hopes does the twenty-one year-old have for getting that elusive first Major?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tournament &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;depth&lt;/em&gt; are terms we commonly hear used in tennis. Yet the sport doesn&amp;rsquo;t have good stats for either of these properties of events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With just one Grand Slam remaining in the 2017 season, it is already clear that one of the biggest stories of the year will be the renaissance of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal&amp;rsquo;s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the major tennis storylines of 2017 has been the opening up of the field on the WTA tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a number of former dominant players, like Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka, out of the game and others, like Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova, still early in their return, 2017 has presented a massive opportunity to the tour&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;rising stars. Out of 13 Premier and Grand Slam events completed this season, 10 different women have taken the title win. This has given tennis fans many possible picks for who will emerge as the next major threat on the WTA tour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After 126 matches, 25 year-old Simona Halep and 20 year-old Jelena Ostapenko are the last women&amp;rsquo;s players remaining. And, whatever the outcome on Saturday in Paris, the women&amp;rsquo;s tour will see a new French Open champion and new Grand Slam title-holder crowned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It only took a few days of main draw play for the 2017 French Open to give fodder to debates on the unpredictability of this year&amp;rsquo;s women&amp;rsquo;s tour. After two rounds, just 9 of the 32 seeds survived to the round of 32, 23 fewer than expected. Those numbers caused &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2017/06/tennis-channel-roland-garros-2017-wta-player-draft-update-french-open/66477/&#34;&gt;tennis.com&lt;/a&gt; to conclude that the women&amp;rsquo;s draw was &amp;ldquo;decimated&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I took a look at the clay-court serve performance of four of the ATP players most in contention for the 2017 Roland Garros title— Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2017/05/21/Top-Contenders-French-Open/&#34;&gt;That analysis&lt;/a&gt; showed that Rafael Nadal has so far separated himself on serve by 5 to 15 percentage points on average. An impressive stat next to anyone but especially when compared to the players who are some of his toughest rivals for another Major win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that the dust has settled at the Rome Masters, the tennis world is turning its focus to the French Open, where main draw play is nearly upon us. With Roger Federer skipping Roland Garros when not injured for the first time since he first played the event in 1999, the four names that will be most in the discussion for the win are Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. In this post, we look at the clay court season so far and what it tells us about the form for each of these top contenders going into the second Major of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this point in the clay season, many of us were expecting Andy Murray to have appeared in at least one or more finals and maybe even snagged a title. But with a Round of 16 loss this week to Borna Coric at the Mutua Madrid Open, Murray has crashed out earlier than expected for his third clay court event of the season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every match win involves some luck. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the coin toss or the bounce off a clipped net, some events in a tennis match are outside of a player&amp;rsquo;s control. And the sport accepts that. But we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t accept it when it comes to line calls, especially when there is technology that can prevent line call errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite starting the 2017 season as World No. 1 for the first time in his career, Andy Murray has had a lackluster go of it so far. After Murray&amp;rsquo;s Round of 16 loss at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, his match record was 13 and 4. Now, in terms of wins and losses alone, that puts him on par with his performances thru the end of April in 2016 and 2014, but far behind his record in 2015 when he had bagged 23 wins and just 5 losses by this point in the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Her first match will be in the middle of the first round of Stuttgart on April 26th where she will have a chance to take 470 ranking points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With all of the tiers that exist on the professional tennis circuit, from 10K events up to the Majors, I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered how tournament tiers should be factored into Elo predictions and whether some events should be excluded entirely. The standard Elo gives players a bigger boost (10% exactly) for wins at Majors but treats wins against similar opponents at any other event the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, you are spending the day after the final match of the 2017 Australian Open looking for ways to relive the startling 35th meeting of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. At the start of the tournament, the chances that Federer would win the title were just 3%; Nadal was an even greater underdog with just 1.5%. Seeing either of them in the final match at Rod Laver Arena wasn&amp;rsquo;t suppose to happen. Yet here we are the day after both men defied the odds and produced what is likely to be one of the most storied moments in tennis history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Even with the men&amp;rsquo;s final still to come, we can already say that the 2017 Australian Open brought more surprises than anyone expected. As much as we will be focused on the surprise of another Williams sister final and the 35th meeting of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overlook the less familiar names that impressed us at the first Slam of the season.
Since it is sometimes hard to look back at two weeks of matchplay and pick out the performances that surprised us most, I was thinking how you might try to put a number to &amp;ldquo;improvement&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to two classic finals in the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s events at this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open. The men&amp;rsquo;s matchup will be the 35th meeting of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer and their 22nd meeting in a tournament final.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, the first of the two men&amp;rsquo;s semifinals was played on Rod Laver Arena. By the end of the second set, it looked like it was going to be a short night for the Australia Day crowd. Then Stan Wawrinka&amp;rsquo;s first break in the fourth game of the third set changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the prospect of a Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer final at this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open, many are probably wondering if we are in store for the relatively speedy match when they last played here in 2014 or an epic more like their four-hour plus semifinal at the 2012 AO. There hasn&amp;rsquo;t been much that is predictable about this year&amp;rsquo;s Australian Open. One had to be clairvoyant to have picked a Nadal-Federer final (if that turns out to be what we get) let alone how long such a meeting could last.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Another match we all hope will deliver the same excitement is Rafael Nadal and Gael Monfils&amp;rsquo; meeting on Monday, in the marquee night match on Rod Laver Arena.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The ousting of Novak Djokovic by Denis Istomin and Aga Radwanska by Mirjana Lucic-Baroni made Day 4 one of the most shocking of the event so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the curious things about tennis is that every seeded player&amp;rsquo;s path to the title is different. When the champions are hoisting a tournament trophy over their heads, we largely ignore the role that luck might have played in their victory. But should it be ignored? And how much of a role does luck play anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week of the 2017 tennis season saw the debut of many of the world&amp;rsquo;s best players. One of the players that tennis fans will be expecting the most from is the recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/british-tennis-star-andy-murray-knighted-after-amazing-season/news-story/6191b34118355421ef96820aa18c2bdc&#34;&gt;knighted Sir Andy Murray&lt;/a&gt;. Not just because of the knighthood but because of last year&amp;rsquo;s miraculous season that propelled that honour and saw Murray do the impossible: take the World No. 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In my last post, I took a look at the distances covered in matches and points for male players. The stats from Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group showed that men at the Australian Open travel 2 to 3 miles per match and the big servers of the game tend to travel the least of all players.
But what about the women&amp;rsquo;s tour? What are the typical distances for them and who are the biggest movers?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a tennis match broadcast you will sometimes see a stat on the distances run by players.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s games differ the most is the serve. While previous posts on this site have shown that the speeds of men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s groundstrokes are actually &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2016/11/26/AOLeaderboard-Forehand-Speed/&#34;&gt;fairly comparable&lt;/a&gt;, the men separate themselves by far on serve. On hard court, the average first serve for men is 115 mph and the average first serve for women is 99 mph.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we think of the best ralliers in the game, we are thinking of the players who not only have a penchant for extended points but also win those points. While tournaments will sometimes tell us about typical rally lengths, we don&amp;rsquo;t usually know how a player&amp;rsquo;s chances of winning a point vary with rally length. In this post, I look into this question using Australian Open statistics provided by the Game Insight Group of Tennis Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Rally lengths are a useful measure for differentiating styles of play. Players who tend to keep points to a few shots would be expected to be dominant on serve and more willing to go to net. Players who tend to grind out extended rallies would tend to be the baseliners whose best weapons are their groundstrokes and endurance.
Some analysts have characterised the professional game as first strike tennis, because the majority of points are 4 shots or fewer (counting the serve).</description>

      <description>In my last post I discussed the idea of return pressure and suggested that it could be measured by looking at the amount of time a receiver gives the server to prepare for their second shot. Players who exert more pressure with their return of serve are expected to get a quicker jump on the ball and make a more powerful shot inside the baseline.
In this post I want to focus on one part of that equation, the quick jump, by looking at reaction times on the serve return.</description>

      <description>The tennis world is gearing up for the ATP World Tour Finals, where 8 of the best male players will vie for the final major title of 2016. One of the things that could be decisive in who advances to the semifinals is the pressure of the return. Here, when I refer to return pressure, I am thinking of the kind of player who jumps on the serve and makes an attacking shot that gives the server little time to react.</description>

With the loss to Marin Cilic in Paris and Andy Murray one win away from taking the World No. 1 spot, the 2016 season has raised many questions about Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s performance. While we see the indicators of a slump from his win record, we can&amp;rsquo;t know whether and how his game has actually changed— has he lost effectiveness on serve?</description>

      <description>This week continues the rollout of a collection of new statistics describing the quality of shots in tennis. Last week began with a look at groundstroke speeds, focusing on the backhand. This week we turn to the accuracy of groundstrokes and look specifically at how frequently shots land close to the line.
Whether a ball lands close to a line is obviously a subjective call. In the summaries that follow, I will use 3 ball lengths (approximately 21 cm) as &amp;ldquo;close&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe that it is only a few months before the start of the 2017 ATP and WTA seasons. Preparations for the 2017 AO in Melbourne are already in high gear. There will be a lot of developments you can expect to see come January, including some new stats using Hawk-Eye ball and player tracking data. These stats were developed by Tennis Australia&amp;rsquo;s Game Insight Group— a team of scientists TA has brought together to advance the use of analytics in tennis. As a data scientist for the GIG, I wanted to preview these developments and some of the things we are learning from tracking data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The purpose of these averages is to focus on how players tend to perform on the most important points in a match. In this way, these stats can help us to find out which players win the majority of the most important points? And which players are most and least affected by the scoreline?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2016/09/23/US-Open-Women-Clutch/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; took us back to the U.S. Open and reviewed the most and least clutch players on the WTA. This week I do the same review for the men. As before, the clutch performance represented here is the summary of the most important points won on serve (Figure 1) and return (Figure 2). These summaries include big points like break points, of course, but also factors in other important points &amp;ndash; like tiebreak points or 30-all situations late in a set. In each case, the score situation is weighed by its relative importance, which is its expected influence on a win or loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The 2016 U.S. Open might now be a faint memory of the news cycle but there are still plenty of stories about player performance that were never told. This week, I have been digging into the point-by-point data from this year&amp;rsquo;s matches at Flushing to find out how players handled the biggest moments of the tournament.
I have talked before about how we can use a point&amp;rsquo;s importance to identify who are the most clutch performers in the sport.</description>

      <description>The final day of the 2016 U.S. Open brought us the 26th meeting of Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka. Djokovic has built up such a win record in recent years that, even at the final stage of a Grand Slam against as formidable an opponent as World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka, he was still the favorite by far. FiveThirtyEight predictions gave the World No. 1 an 88% chance of winning his 13th Major title.</description>

      <description>After three sets on a muggy Saturday in New York, Angelique Kerber defeated Karolina Pliskova to win her first U.S. Open Major and her second Grand Slam title of the year. Kerber had already secured the World No. 1 rank in getting to the finals, after Williams defeat to Pliskova in the semifinal. Pliskova was on a terrifying run, taking out both Williams sisters to get her spot in the final.</description>

      <description>After a day of women&amp;rsquo;s semifinals that saw the exit and dethroning of World No. 1 Serena Williams, the favorites in the men&amp;rsquo;s semifinals had to be on guard when they stepped onto court today. The first match of the day pitted a fresh Novak Djokovic against showman and crowd favorite Gael Monfils. The day was be closed out by the matchup of Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka. Both matches were hard-fought and delivered a packed highlight reel.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shocks keep coming at the U.S. Open. After Kei Nishikori&amp;rsquo;s surprising upset of Andy Murray in the quarterfinals of Day 10, Day 11 brought us another massive upset. Today it was Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; turn to exit the tournament, as Karolina Pliskova denied her a 23rd major title. After the loss to Roberta Vinci at the 2015 U.S. Open, this makes for back-to-back disappointments for Williams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today wrapped up the last half of the men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s quarterfinals of the 2016 U.S. Open. Two of the favorites for the title—Serena Williams and Andy Murray—were on center stage. Serena Williams was tested by a determined Simona Halep but would eventually make it through. Andy Murray, on the other hand, would fall in 5 to Japanese No 1. Kei Nishikori. Here are visual summaries of how those and the two other quarterfinal matches of the day were decided.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are nearing the end of the first day of Round 3 and the surprises continue. There were some big wins and near big losses for the players at Flushing today. In this post, I will look at the point-by-point predictions for 5 of the day&amp;rsquo;s tightest matches. By looking over the charts of the match-in-progress can help us appreciate how a match was won and what some of the most shocking wins of the day were.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final day of Round 2 at the 2016 U.S. Open brought some more upsets and nail-biting battles. I have selected 6 of the most contested matches of the day and created point-by-point prediction charts to track the ebbs and flows of each. The expectations for each match are based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-us-open-tennis-predictions/mens/&#34;&gt;player Elo ratings&lt;/a&gt;. These ratings tells us how capable a player should be of winning a match against their drawn opponent if both players are playing to their expected ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Round 2 of the 2016 U.S. Open, an American served up what could turn out to be one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Ryan Harrison, ranked 220 in the world and known mostly for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/at-wimbledon-ryan-harrison-suffers-again-from-his-bad-luck-of-the-draw/&#34;&gt;streak of unlucky draws&lt;/a&gt; at Grand Slams, defeated huge-hitting World No. 6 Milos Raonic 6-7 (4), 7-5, 7-5, 6-1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have gotten through the first round and already the 2016 U.S. Open has given us a number of epics. One of those was the all-American matchup of Jack Sock and Taylor Fritz, a match that was highlighted in the clutch preview &lt;a href=&#34;http://on-the-t.com/2016/08/29/US-Open-Mens-First-Round-Preview/&#34;&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first round of the main draw of the 2016 US Open begins today. If you are like me you have spent a good part of the weekend digesting the draw and making predictions about which matches could be the most interesting to come out of Flushing Meadows. In this post, I want to highlight a few of the matches that stood out to me. In doing so, I also want to introduce a new way of looking at recent form with something I call &lt;strong&gt;clutch averaging&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As with the men&amp;rsquo;s preview, I have selected among matches of players who have some match history and have reported. For each match, clutch summary statistics of the players&amp;rsquo; last meeting and most recent result are shown.</description>

      <description>In statistics, an expectation is a way to quantify what is typical or likely. And, when we compare what actually happened against what was expected, we have a way to judge how surprised or unimpressed we should be.
Despite their usefulness, you are as likely to see a probabilistic expectation in tennis as you are a floral pattern at Wimbledon. Mainstream tennis stats only report what happened, not what was likely to happen.</description>

      <description>One of the many things I miss after the dissolution of Bill Simmons&amp;rsquo; sports blog Grantland is Kirk Goldsberry&amp;rsquo;s NBA shot charts. The classic version of the Goldsberry shot chart is a plot of hexagonal bins showing the locations and frequency of where a player takes shots overlaid onto a representation of the basketball court. Combined with heavy annotation and a lot of style, the charts are both effective at communicating shot tendencies and a pure pleasure to read (an example for Steph Curry is shown to the right).</description>

      <description>July has been a stellar month for British player Johanna Konta. After defeating one of her idols, Venus Williams, to win a Premier title at Stanford, Konta will play today for a spot in the semifinal of the Rogers Cup.
Embed from Getty Images This month, Konta just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to lose. When players hit a streak like Konta has, it can sometime seem like winning becomes inevitable, as if with each win added to their record the next win becomes even more likely.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2016 Wimbledon Championships brought us a number of stories and memorable matches. But, with the third round exit of Novak Djokovic, we &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; get to see a semifinal between Djokovic and Federer. We will have to wait a few more weeks for the arrival of the US Open for the next opportunity to see if Federer can still test Djokovic on a slam stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a sad day for Federer fans. After a glorious comeback from two sets down in the quarterfinals, Federer&amp;rsquo;s bid for an eighth Wimbledon title was cut short by big-serving Milos Raonic on Friday.
Like most close matches, the margins separating Federer and Raonic were tiny. With 70% of points won on serve and 29% of points won on return, Federer was just one percentage point behind the Canadian star on both skills.</description>

      <description>One of the matches we can look forward to—rain or shine—on Day 6 of the Wimbledon Championships is World No. 2 Andy Murray against Aussie John Millman. Murray&amp;rsquo;s run at Wimbledon is an especially interesting one because it is the first Grand Slam since Murray&amp;rsquo;s reunion with legend coach Ivan Lendl. The on-again off-again partnership provides an interesting natural experiment of the &amp;ldquo;coach effect&amp;rdquo; and gives us one more reason to look back at one of my favorite tennis memes of all time.</description>

      <description>Choking is one of the most fascinating phenomena in sport. 2016 provided us with a spectacular example of a choke when Jordan Spieth made a quadruple-bogey on hole 12 of the Augusta Masters, setting into motion the loss of a near-certain win on the final day on those hallowed links.
Although we may not ever see a meltdown of that magnitude again for years to come, it still serves as a reminder of the role of pressure in competition.</description>

On the women&amp;rsquo;s side, twenty-two year old Garbiñe Muguruza, a rising star with only one previous appearance in a Grand Slam final, thwarted Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; third bid at her twenty-second title to her first major win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zebra prints and back-to-back matches haven&amp;rsquo;t been the only strange things to appear at this year&amp;rsquo;s French Open. The washout that has been a catastrophe for the 2016 Roland Garros schedule has created a myriad of unusual pressures and demands for the players (and a few of them have been vocal about their dislike of the situation). As a consequence of all this, player adaptability and grit have taken higher places in the list of skills needed to advance to the next round than would be the case in drier conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.si.com/si-beyond-the-baseline-tennis-podcast&#34;&gt;Beyond the Baseline&lt;/a&gt; preview to the French Open, Jon Wertheim called the women&amp;rsquo;s draw from spot 2 down &amp;ldquo;all over the place&amp;rdquo;. With only 2 2016 clay court titles among the top 4 seeds on the women&amp;rsquo;s side and Serena Williams without a major title since last year&amp;rsquo;s Wimbledon, it&amp;rsquo;s looking like anyone&amp;rsquo;s guess over which WTA player will walk away with the Roland Garros title in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After Novak Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s surprising early exit last month at the Monte Carlo Masters tournament, this week it was Roger Federer&amp;rsquo;s turn. His first clay court event since Monte Carlo was brought to a decisive halt when he lost to Dominic Thiem in the third round at the Rome Masters.
Now any player can have an off day, especially when coming back from injury. But when it happens to the best players in the game, it&amp;rsquo;s often the source of alarm.</description>

      <description>After two close semifinals, World No. 2 Andy Murray is set to defend his Madrid Masters title against top seed Novak Djokovic. The fact that the two go into the match at the top of the ATP rankings leaderboard suggests that we are in store for a quality match, with Djokovic being the perennial favorite.
But what exactly does the difference of one position in ranking really tell us about the expected quality of play?</description>

But the tables quickly turned and after taking the second sets in 6-2 and 6-3, Thiem ultimately prevailed, securing a spot in the final against Philipp Kohlschreiber.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The break-heavy clay court season continued in the men&amp;rsquo;s semifinal match where World No. 5 Rafael Nadal faced-off against 31st-ranked Fabio Fognini. There were a total of 8 breaks in the match, 4 in each set. There were also two of the most frustrating of break phenomena, the back-to-back break. The first came in the fifth game of the first set, when Fognini broke Nadal&amp;rsquo;s serve and put himself on the scoreboard for the first time.</description>

      <description>With the second round exit of Novak Djokovic and the quarterfinal loss of Roger Federer, the finals of the 2016 Monte Carlo Masters brought us a pairing we might not have expected on Day 1, but a thrilling one nonetheless. The first two sets between Rafael Nadal and Gael Monfils on Sunday were as tightly contested as the fans that withstood a rainy morning in Monaco could have hoped for. Each player exchanged a 7-5 win, battling through multiple long rallies and over two hours of matchplay to reach the third deciding set.</description>

      <description>Raymond Moore&amp;rsquo;s display of sexism at this year&amp;rsquo;s BNP Paribas Open put a more intense spotlight on gender equality in tennis than any of us were expecting. The processing of his statements and resignation as tournament director prompted some insightful perspective-taking by former and current players. At the same time, it also encouraged more of the same old pitting of the WTA and ATP tours against each other.
With this backdrop in mind, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but cringe when I read myth 6 of Klaasseen and Magnus: &amp;lsquo;the probability that the service is in is the same in men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s singles&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The 5th myth in Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s examination of some of the most common beliefs in tennis puts point importance at center stage once again. With myth 5, K&amp;amp;M ask if there is any truth to the idea that all points in tennis are equally important.
Of all of the 22 beliefs that K&amp;amp;M consider in Analyzing Wimbledon this is the one that probably has the least traction in the tennis community.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth myth in the countdown of Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s 22 myths of tennis is &lt;em&gt;the myth of the seventh game&lt;/em&gt;. Listen to enough tennis commentary or read through enough posts on tennis forums and you are bound to come across the idea that the seventh game is the most important game in the set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Last week many of the sports world&amp;rsquo;s most innovative number crunchers converged in Boston at the MIT Sloan Analytics Conference. The 10th anniversary of the two-day nerd fest attracted 3,900 attendees and some of the heaviest hitters in sports stats, including Bill James, Nate Silver, and Mike Zarren.
One of the traditional features of Sloan is the research competition. In true sporting fashion, this is a multi-stage, single-elimination tournament that pits the top research innovations in sports analytics against each other.</description>

      <description>The next myth in our look back at Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s takedown of 22 tennis myths is Myth 3. This myth concerns the importance of points and whether each point is equally important to the server and returner.
Myth 3: &amp;ldquo;Every point (game, set) is equally important to both players&amp;rdquo; In Analyzing Wimbledon Klaassen and Magnus make the logically argument that a point is always equally important to the server and receiver.</description>

      <description>The second myth addressed in Klaassen and Magnus&amp;rsquo;s instant classic of tennis analysis, Analyzing Wimbledon, is the myth of serving first in a match.
Myth 2: &amp;ldquo;Is there an advantage to serve first in a set?&amp;rdquo; The coin toss is one of those pre-match rituals that many of us fast-forward through. If you can recall any occasion when you have stopped to watch the coin toss, there is a very good chance that the player who won the toss opted to serve.</description>

      <description>Books on tennis statistics are as rare as black swans. So I take notice whenever one appears.
One of the most recent of these scarce creatures is Franc Klaassen and Jan Magnus&amp;rsquo;s Analyzing Wimbledon. Despite having primary appointments in economic departments, Klaassen and Magnus have produced some of the most scholarly mathematical papers on tennis. Analyzing Wimbledon is a compilation of the findings that have come out of their long partnership, synthesized into a list of 22 myths of tennis.</description>

Still, every year the data the sport gathers and makes available to the public is way too basic. You know those end-of-match summaries with the simple counts of first serve points, second serve points, etc.</description>

      <description>After solidifying a career best season with the win of the ATP Tour Finals, definitive World No. 1 Novak Djokovic set the tennis world chattering about where his 2015 season stood in the history of best tennis seasons. It is fitting for these discussions that Djokovic&amp;rsquo;s last win of 2015 was over Roger Federer, the current World No. 3 whose achievements in the mid 2000s have often been argued to be some of the greatest in the Open Era.</description>

      <description>Last week I asked whether WAR, a comprehensive statistic of player value, has a place in tennis. Although WAR was developed for and has been primarily used in team sports to estimate a player&amp;rsquo;s contribution to team wins, its potential applications are much broader. WAR, in its most general sense, is about giving perspective to a player&amp;rsquo;s performance by comparing the outcomes of a player&amp;rsquo;s outings to a common standard: the replacement player.</description>

This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that kind of war (as much as &lt;em&gt;ESPN&lt;/em&gt; might be interested in such a gladiatorial venture); it&amp;rsquo;s about the sabermetric kind of WAR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, FiveThirtyEight writer Oliver Roeder published an article entitled &amp;ldquo;Can An Astrophysicist Change The Way We Watch Sports?&amp;quot; The piece documents the efforts of Matt Ginsberg (the astrophysicist in question) to develop a system for real-time predictions of shot-making for the NBA and, at the same time, raises a number of broad questions about the future of advanced analytics in sports and sports broadcasting. One of the questions that most intrigued me is whether, as the title of the article suggests, any one person can &amp;ldquo;revolutionize&amp;rdquo; how we experience sports?</description>

      <description>Last week I openly admitted to a new obsession with break points, which has lead me down a path of investigations to try to understand the role of break points for winning in tennis. One product to come out of this is the concept of break point decisiveness, which I define as the percentage of matches in which the winner also won more break points than the loser. My last post showed that break point decisiveness ranges from 87 to 91% for the ATP, depending on which surface and match format (best of 3 or best of 5) is being played.</description>

      <description>As part of the work I have been doing on the Pythagorean model for wins in tennis, I have—in-between MLB playoffs and the Shanghai Masters, in any case—been thinking a lot about break points lately.
We all know break points are important. If a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t edge out his or her opponent&amp;rsquo;s break points won in a set, the set (and ultimately the match) will have to be decided in a tiebreak or, when a tiebreak isn&amp;rsquo;t in place, a match could go on ad infinitum as some of us thought might happen when big servers Isner and Mahut butted heads in the 2010 Wimbledon first round.</description>

      <description>Last week, based on work presented at the 2015 NESSIS, I wrote about an extension of Pythagorean Expectation to tennis, which showed that break point conversion has a strikingly similar ability to predict match wins in tennis as runs predict team wins in baseball. The Pythagorean analyses were based only on the men&amp;rsquo;s tour. In this post, thanks to match statistics published by Jeff Sackmann of Tennis Abstract, I will examine the existence of a Pythagorean formula for women&amp;rsquo;s tennis.</description>

      <description>In the short life of this blog, I have, on several occasions, complained about the lack of analytics in tennis. But what evidence is there to back up this view? One place to start to unpack the state of analytics in tennis is by comparison to other major sports that are at the forefront of the analytics revolution. In this article I want to discuss one gap that such a comparison reveals— the lack of metrics for win expectation.</description>

      <description>With the existence of Hawkeye and the IBM Slamtracker, tennis fans might be under the impression that the CPUs of tennis analysts are overflowing with high-quality stroke-by-stroke data on today&amp;rsquo;s matches. Regrettably, this is far from the truth. The data that drives the most interesting visualizations during a broadcasts, like summaries of the frequency of shots by their position on court, or the data behind the Challenge System are under the proprietary control of a few corporate giants (IBM for the Slams, SAP for the WTA), which means they are also out-of-reach of tennis researchers.</description>

      <description>Today, Roger Federer will make his first appearance at a US Open final since 2009, where he lost to Juan Martin Del Potro. Since that match, Federer has reached the finals of 5 other Grand Slams but has not won a title since his 2012 victory at Wimbledon over Andy Murray. Following that title win, he has advanced to a final at two Slams, the 2014 and 2015 Wimbledon Championships; in each case, losing to Novak Djokovic.</description>

      <title>Did the US Open Rob Serena of a Calendar Slam?</title>

      <description>Serena Williams&amp;rsquo; loss to unseeded Roberta Vinci at the 2015 US Open semifinal put a shocking end to Williams&amp;rsquo; run for a Calendar Slam. When Vinci stepped onto Ashe yesterday, the task before her must have seemed unthinkable. She had never won a set against Williams in their 4 previous meetings, and all of their prior matches were before the semifinal round, when Williams&amp;rsquo; is known not to play at her highest level.</description>

      <description>At the 2015 US Open, IBM is continuing its long partnership with the USTA to bring tennis fans &amp;ldquo;more than the score&amp;quot;. One of the main ways that Big Blue is going beyond the score is with their Keys to the Match&amp;ndash;basically, a dashboard with performance targets for a given head-to-head.
If you are like me and have ever perused the Keys on a changeover over player bathroom break, you might have wondered exactly what insights they contain.</description>

      <description>When Serena Williams turns 34 in a few weeks, she will very likely have added a 22nd Major title and Calendar Slam to her CV&amp;ndash;securing her reign as the most decorated thirty-and-over in the sport. A decade ago, few would have believed that a tennis player in her mid-thirties would be at the peak of her game. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that Williams&amp;rsquo; achievements and resurgence at this stage in her career are exceptional.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heat was the main topic of discussion on Day 4 of the US Open. The brutal effects of sweltering temperatures and stifling humidity took centerstage during the afternoon play when American Jack Sock collapsed in the third set of his match against Ruben Bemelmans. Sock&amp;ndash;who looked unconscious as the medical team on site rushed to his aid&amp;ndash;was forced to retire and was subsequently diagnosed with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/09/03/american-tennis-player-jack-sock-collapses-on-court-at-u-s-open/&#34;&gt;heat illness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Day 4 of the 2015 US Open and the tournament has already brought a lot of surprises. While we all might have expected Nick Kyrgios to exit with flare in the first round, few of us would have anticipated that the first round would say farewell to so many of the seeds. The ladies&amp;rsquo; draw feels especially bare after 11 of 32 seeds (34%) did not advance to the second round&amp;ndash;Stephens (29), Pavlyuchenkova (31), Pliskova (8), Kuznetsova (30), Suarez Navarro (10), Jankovic (21), Ivanovic (7), Safarova (6), Begu (28), Bacsinszky (14), Cornet (27).</description>

      <description>The sabermetric revolution popularized by Moneyball forever changed the way we experience and appreciate America&amp;rsquo;s pastime. Since then, more and more sports organisations have begun to see the value of statistical analysis and opened up positions for statisticians.
Over the past decade, statistical thinking in sport has begun to spread. And we can see the impact of analytics in the way it has reshaped recruitment, game style, and game experience for many of the most popular global sports.</description>

These are a margin of victory based Elo rating system that accounts not only for the win result but also the game margin (games won minus games lost). Ratings are based on matches played above the Futures/ITF level, including qualifying and main draw matches. Surface-adjusted ratings weight all-surface and surface-specific ratings according to the correlation of each with win results and the surface in question.</description>

      <title>Serena Williams’ Only Obstacle to a Calendar Slam is Herself</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a 21-minute opening match at the US Open that ended with her opponent&amp;rsquo;s retirement, Serena Williams is now 6 victories from her first Calendar Slam and 22nd career major title, tying her with Steffi Graf for the woman with the most Slam titles in the Open Era. Williams comes to Flushing Methods with a season match record of 48 wins to 2 losses—a record so close to perfection that you couldn’t blame her if she strutted onto Arthur Ashe and talked trash on a changeover or two (young Aussies, take note). But don’t expect Williams to rock swag until the Open trophy is sitting securely in her hands. As much as the wins keep coming, the queen of the court’s confidence has been in a perplexing slump.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The most surprising runs of all time on the ATPDenis Shapovalov surprised the tennis world in Montreal by reaching the semi finals in stunning fashion, beating Del Potro and Nadal back-to-back. This made me wonder: was this one of the most surprising runs ever in tennis?To try to answer this question, I look at the likelihood of players&amp;rsquo; runs under Elo. The likelihood is simply the probabilities of multiple events multiplied together.</description>
